# Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum (CAC) Simulator

CACS is a code for running concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) simulations. It is developed by the group of [Prof. David L. McDowell ](http://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/mcdowell) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the group of [Prof. Youping Chen](http://web.mae.ufl.edu/chenlab/) at the University of Florida and the group of [Prof. Liming Xiong](http://www.aere.iastate.edu/lmxiong/) at the Iowa State University. The code development is sponsored by the National Science Foundation as a collaborative effort between Georgia Tech (CMMI-1232878) and University of Florida (CMMI-1233113).
