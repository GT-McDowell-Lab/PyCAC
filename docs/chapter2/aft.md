## Atomic field theory

In AFT, a crystalline material is viewed as a continuous collection of lattice points; embedded within each point is a unit cell with a group of discrete atoms, as shown in the figure below. In this way, the micromorphic theory is connected with molecular dynamics and is expanded to the atomic scale. Here, the local density function is continuous at the level of the unit cell, but discrete in terms of the discrete atoms inside the unit cell. AFT was originally designed with polyatomic crystalline materials in mind, but can also be applied to monatomic crystals.

Left in (a) and (b) is the reference state at time 0 while right is the deformation state at time $$t$$. $$\mathbf{X}$$ and $$\mathbf{x}$$ are the positions of the mass center of the unit cell, $$\Xi$$ and $$\xi$$ are internal positions, $$\mathbf{Y}$$ and $$\mathrm{y}^\alpha$$ are positions of atom $$\alpha$$ with respect to $$\Xi$$ and $$\xi$$, respectively, $$N_\alpha$$ is the number of atoms in a unit cell.</figcaption></figure>
