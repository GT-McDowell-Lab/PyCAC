## A brief history of CACThe CAC method is based on a concurrent atomistic-continuum formulation of balance laws [1,2] that are implemented using a finite element (FE) strategy, with the interatomic potential as the only constitutive relation. The formulation of the CAC balance equations, originally referred to as an atomic micromorphic theory or [atomistic field theory (AFT)](aft.md) by [Youping Chen](http://web.mae.ufl.edu/chenlab) and [James D. Lee](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/james-d-lee) [1,3-8], is an extension of the Irving Kirkwood's formulation of "_the hydrodynamics equations for a single component, single phase system_" [9] to a two-level structural description of crystalline materials. The CAC formulation differs from that of classical continuum mechanics in that it employs a two-level structural description of materials. It is also distinct from the well-established theories of generalized continuum mechanics such as the Cosserat theory [10], micropolar theory [11,12], and micromorphic theory [13,14] in that the sub-level structural description is not continuous but discrete.

The first version of the CAC numerical tool was developed by [Liming Xiong](https://www.aere.iastate.edu/lmxiong/) ([Ph.D. 2011](http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0042371/00001)) and [Qian Deng](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/tonydqian) ([Ph.D. 2011](http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0043632/00001)). The reformulated balance equations were numerically implemented using FE method with trilinear FE shape functions and nodal integration, and the simulation tool was demonstrated to be able to capture the phenomenon of phase transition in Si [15] and the dynamic processes of fracture, including crack initiation, propagation and branching (Fig. 1) [16,17].  <figure><img src='fig/deng.png'><figcaption>Figure 1. Time sequence of CAC simulations of a brittle material (2.24 $$\mu\mathrm{m}$$ by 1.4 $$\mu\mathrm{m}$$) showing (a) stress waves emitting from a propagating crack; (b) and (c) crack branching as a result of the interactions between waves propagating from the crack tip and those reflected from the specimen boundaries [17].</figcaption></figure><br>The form and capabilities of the CAC method were extended substantially as a direct result of collaborative efforts between [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/) and [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/) in modeling and simulations of the dynamics of dislocations: elements that have discontinuities between them were employed, and the Gaussian quadrature was used for integration in the coarse-grained domain. Nucleation and propagation of dislocations in the coarse-grained domain [18,19], passing dislocations from the atomistic domain to the coarse-grained domain [20], the growth of dislocation loops in Cu, Al and Si (Fig. 2(a)) [21], fast moving dislocations (Fig. 2(b)) [22], and other progresses [23-26], have been successfully simulated without special numerical treatment or supplemental constitutive relations. The name "CAC" for the methodology was coined by [David L. McDowell](http://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/mcdowell) in 2010.<figure><img src='fig/xiong.png'><figcaption>Figure 2. (a) CAC simulation results of the nucleation and growth of dislocation loops in Cu, Al, Si [21]. (b) Time sequences of dislocation motions in MD and fully coarse-grained CAC simulations [22].</figcaption></figure> 
<br>The CAC code was rewritten using Fortran 90 by [Shengfeng Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangshengfeng/) ([Ph.D. 2014](http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0047355/00001)) for multiscale simulation of polycrystalline ionic materials. This is the second-generation of the CAC code. It employs the Wolf method to calculate the long-range Columbic force and a special type of element (i.e., an incomplete element) to model regions with defects such as grain boundaries (GBs) in polyatomic materials. This version of the CAC code enables multiple meshing resolutions and simulation of two or more materials (e.g., Si and Ge), with multiple types of interatomic potentials, including the Buckingham and the Stillinger-Weber potentials. The CAC code was demonstrated to reproduce the equilibrium structures and energies of GBs in SrTiO$$_3$$, in good agreement with those obtained from existing experiments and density functional theory calculations. The code has been used to study the dynamic processes of crack initiation as well as the evolution of dislocation in single crystalline [27], bicrytalline [28], and polycrystalline SrTiO$$_3$$ (Fig. 3) [29,30].<figure><img src='fig/yang.png'><figcaption>Figure 3. (a) A CAC model of polycrystalline SrTiO$$_3$$ (2D view) in which the GBs are modeled with atomic resolution and the grains with coarse-scale finite elements; (b) Central symmetry parameter plot of the deformed model showing the nucleation and propagation of many dislocations and their interactions with the GBs; The comparison between (c) CAC and (d) MD simulation results is shown at strain 8.7% [30].</figcaption></figure><br>The CAC code was also rewritten by [Shuozhi Xu](https://shuozhixu.cnsi.ucsb.edu/) ([Ph.D. 2016](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/56314)) using Fortran 2008. The code was optimized and the efficiency was significantly improved. The code includes the quasistatic version of CAC to carry out quasistatic simulations so as to obtain energy minimized atomic and nodal structures, in addition to dynamic simulation. This version of code, termed [PyCAC](../README.md), has been well tested for ductile fracture [31], quasistatic dislocation migration [32], screw dislocation cross-slip [33], edge dislocations bowing out from obstacles [34], dislocation multiplication from Frank-Read sources [35], dislocation/stacking fault interactions [36], and dislocation/GB interactions (Fig. 4) [37,38].<figure><img src='fig/xu.jpg'><figcaption>Figure 4. Snapshots of dislocation pile-up with dominant leading screw character impinging against a $$\Sigma 3$${111} coherent twin boundary (CTB) [38]. In (a), five incoming dislocations approach the CTB subject to an applied shear stress. In (b), the leading dislocation is constricted at the CTB, where two Shockley partial dislocations are recombined into a full dislocation. In (c), with certain interatomic potentials, the dislocation effectively cross-slips into the outgoing twinned grain via redissociation into two partials. In (d), with different potentials, the redissociated dislocation is absorbed by the CTB, with two partials gliding on the twin plane in opposite directions.</figcaption></figure><br>Based on the Fortran 90 code, [Xiang Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qdz0cy4AAAAJ&hl=en) ([Ph.D. 2016](http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0050325/00001)) extended the CAC method for space- and time-resolved simulation of the transient processes of the propagation of heat pulses in single crystals and across GBs [39] as well as the interactions between heat pulses and moving dislocations (Fig. 5) [40]. A phonon representation of the heat pulses, termed a coherent phonon pulse model [41], was created to mimic the coherent lattice excitation achieved via ultrashort laser pulses, and was incorporated into the framework of CAC to provide a coupled treatment for defect dynamics and phonon thermal transport. A first attempt was made to pass full phonon spectrum from the atomistic domain to the coarse-grained domain by introducing a wave-based interpolation scheme [42].<figure><img src='fig/chenx.png'><figcaption>Figure 5.
