## A brief history of CACThe CAC method is based on a concurrent atomistic-continuum formulation of balance laws [110,115,116] that are implemented using a finite element (FE) strategy, with the interatomic potential as the only constitutive relation. The formulation of the CAC balance equations, originally referred to as an [atomistic field theory (AFT)](aft.md) by [Prof. Youping Chen](http://web.mae.ufl.edu/chenlab) and [Prof. James D. Lee](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/james-d-lee), is an extension of the Irving Kirkwood's formulation of "the hydrodynamics equations for a single component, single phase system" [35] to a two-level structural description of crystalline materials. The CAC formulation differs from that of classical continuum mechanics in that it employs a two-level structural description of materials. It is also distinct from the well-established theories of generalized continuum mechanics such as the Cosserat theory [13], micropolar theory [14,15], and micromorphic theory[16-21] in that the sub-level structural description is not continuous but discrete.

The first version of the CAC numerical tool was developed by [Liming Xiong](https://www.aere.iastate.edu/lmxiong/) (Ph.D. 2011) and [Qian Deng](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/tonydqian) (Ph.D. 2011). The reformulated balance equations were numerically implemented using finite element method with trilinear FE shape functions and nodal integration, and the simulation tool was demonstrated to be able to capture the phenomenon of phase transition in Si and the dynamic processes of fracture, including crack initiation, propagation and branching, as shown in Fig. 2.  ![deng](fig/deng.png)

Reproduced from Ref. [78].  The form and capabilities of the CAC method were extended substantially as a direct result of collaborative efforts between University of Florida and Georgia Tech in modeling and simulations of the dynamics of dislocations. [Liming Xiong](https://www.aere.iastate.edu/lmxiong/) (Ph.D. 2011) pioneered the CAC simulations of dislocations with discontinuous elements in the coarse-grained domain. Nucleation and propagation of dislocations in coarse grained regions, passing dislocations from the atomic region to coarse-scale FE regions, the growth of dislocation loops in Cu, Al and Si, fast moving dislocations, etc. (see Fig. 3), have been successfully simulated without special numerical treatment or supplemental constitutive relations. The name "CAC" for the methodology was coined by [Prof. David L. McDowell](http://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/mcdowell) in 2010.![xiong](fig/xiong.png)

[2]. The CAC code was rewritten using Fortran 90 by [Shengfeng Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangshengfeng/) (Ph.D. 2014) for multiscale simulation of polycrystalline ionic materials. This is the second-generation of the CAC code. It employs the Wolf method to calculate the long-range Columbic force and a special type of element (i.e., an incomplete element) to model regions with defects such as grain boundaries in polyatomic materials. This version of the CAC code enables multiple meshing resolutions and simulation of two or more materials (e.g., Si and Ge), with multiple types of interatomic potentials, including the Buckingham and the Stillinger-Weber potentials. The CAC code was demonstrated to reproduce the equilibrium structures and energies of grain boundaries (GBs) in SrTiO$$_3$$, in good agreement with those obtained from existing experiments and density functional theory calculations. The code has been used to study the dynamic processes of crack initiation as well as the evolution of dislocation in single-crystal, bicrytal, and polycrystalline SrTiO$$_3$$ (Fig. 4). ![yang](fig/yang.png)

Reproduced from Ref. [3].The CAC code was also rewritten by [Shuozhi Xu](https://shuozhixu.cnsi.ucsb.edu/) (Ph.D. 2016) using Fortran 2008. The code was optimized and the efficiency was dramatically improved. The code includes the quasistatic version of CAC to carry out quasistatic simulations so as to obtain energy minimized atomic and nodal structures, mesh refinement schemes for dynamic fracture and curved dislocation migration, in addition to dynamic simulation. This version of code, termed PyCAC, has been well tested for screw dislocation cross-sliop, edge dislocation bowing out, dislocation multiplication from Frank-Read sources, dislocation/GB interactions (Fig. 5), etc.![xu](fig/xu.jpg)
Figure 5. Snapshots of dislocation pile-up with dominant leading screw character impinging against a $$\Sigma 3$${111} coherent twin boundary (CTB). In (a), five incoming dislocations approach the CTB subject to an applied shear stress. In (b), the leading dislocation is constricted at the CTB, where two Shockley partial dislocations are recombined into a full dislocation. In (c), with certain interatomic potentials, the dislocation effectively cross-slips into the outgoing twinned grain via redissociation into two partials. In (d), with different potentials, the redissociated dislocation is absorbed by the CTB, with two partials gliding on the twin plane in opposite directions. Reproduced from Ref. [4].[Xiang Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qdz0cy4AAAAJ&hl=en) (Ph.D. 2016) extended the CAC method for space- and time-resolved simulation of the transient processes of the propagation of heat pulses in single crystals and across grain boundaries as well as the interactions between heat pulses and moving dislocations, as shown in Fig. 6. A phonon representation of the heat pulses, termed a coherent phonon pulse (CPP) model [100], was created to mimic the coherent lattice excitation achieved via ultrashort laser pulses, and was incorporated into the framework of CAC to provide a coupled treatment for defect dynamics and phonon thermal transport. A first attempt was made to pass full phonon spectrum from the atomic region to coarse-scaled finite element region by introducing a wave-based interpolation scheme.![chen,x](fig/chenx.png)
Figure 6. In fully coarse-grained CAC simulations of a 2D FCC rare-gas single crystal, normalized kinetic energy distributions show the transient processes of the propagation of (a) a single dislocation and (b) multiple dislocations and their interactions with a coherent phonon or heat pulse. The curves are plots of the dislocation velocity as a function of time with and without the introduction of a phonon pulse; the curves in (b) are for the 6th dislocation which is nucleated from the same location of the specimen as the single dislocation in (a). The snapshots on the right-hand-side are stress distributions with illustrations showing the details of dislocation/phonons interaction. Reproduced from Ref. [5].
