# Background

The theoretical foundation of the CAC method is the atomic field theory (AFT) proposed by [Prof. Youping Chen](http://web.mae.ufl.edu/chenlab) and [Prof. James D. Lee](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/james-d-lee). AFT is based on the micromorphic field theory which, along with microstretch and micropolar field theory, belong to the more general microcontinuum field theory, a.k.a., generalized continuum theory, pioneered by numerous mechanicians, among whom the late [Prof. Ahmed Cemal Eringen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Cemal_Eringen), who was Prof. James D. Lee's Ph.D. advisor.
