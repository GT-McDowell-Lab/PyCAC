The IDs of these groups are after the regular groups created by the group command. The groups created using this command are rigid, i.e., the elements/nodes/atoms are not displaced subject to the interatomic forces, expect (possibly) following the overall deformation of the simulation cell.\nboolean_l and boolean_u decide whether the lower and upper boundaries along each axis are involved, respectively. If any of these two boolean is true, style_cg and style_at decide whether the group contains elements, nodes, atoms, or null, see here for the differences between element and node.\nAll groups defined by the bd_group command have a block shape. Along the y axis, for example, the two block-shape groups are bounded by\nx inf inf y inf depth z inf inf\nx inf inf y upper_b-depth inf z inf inf\nwhere upper_b is the upper bound of the simulation cell, similar to that in the group command. Note that the depth must be a real number, e.g., 2., instead of an integer, e.g., 2.

Following the standard indexes in continuum mechanics, i and j are the face on which and the direction along which the strain is applied. When i and j are the same, a uniaxial strain is set, otherwise, a shear strain is set.\ndef_rate is the strain rate, in the unit of ps$$^{-1}$$.\nstress_l and stress_u are the lower and upper bounds of the applied stress, respectively, for the stress tensor component specified by ij, in unit of GPa. Assume that all stress components are initially zero or very small. Then when the stress component is higher than stress_u, the corresponding strain rate changes sign, i.e., the deformation is reversed. Afterward, when the stress component is lower than stress_l, the corresponding strain rate changes sign again, i.e., the deformation proceeds as the initial setting. Whether the stress component is out of the bounds is checked not every step, but at every flip_frequency step.\nThe deformation begins after time step time_start and ends after time_end. When the time step is larger than time_always_flip but smaller than time_end, the strain rate changes sign at every step back and forth, regardless of the stress bounds defined by stress_l and stress_u.\nRelated commands\nGroups defined by the group and bd_group commands may be homogeneous deformed along with the simulation cell, depending on settings in those two commands.\nRelated files\ndeform_init.f90 and deform_box.f90\nDefault\nboolean_def = f.\n"},"chapter5/dump.html":{"url":"chapter5/dump.html","title":"dump","keywords":"","body":"dump\nSyntax\ndump output_freq reduce_freq restart_freq log_freq\n\noutput_freq, reduce_freq, restart_freq, log_freq = integer\n\nExamples\ndump 500 300 1000 10\nDescription\nSet the frequency by which the output is performed.

Note that these five quantities are relevant only when the group_shape is block.\nWhen boolean_in is t, elements/nodes/atoms inside the group_shape belong to the group; otherwise, those outside the group_shape do.\ngroup_axis is the central axis of the group; it is relevant only when the group_shape is cylinder or cone.\ngroup_centroid_x, group_centroid_y, and group_centroid_z are the coordinates of the center of the base plane of a cylinder or cone, or the center of a sphere. For the cylinder or cone, the group_centroid which corresponds to the group_axis becomes irrelevant.\ngroup_radius_large and group_radius_small are the large and small radius of the group when the group_shape is cylinder or cone or sphere. The first quantity is relevant for all three group_shape while the second quantity is so only for the smaller base of the cone.\nNote that the group_axis, group_centroid, and group_radius options are not relevant when the group_shape is block.\nWhen boolean_move is t, the group is assigned a velocity, including the case that the velocity is zero; otherwise, there will be no constraints to the group and all following options become irrelevant. In any case, the group can be used for property calculations in the cal command.\nWhen boolean_release is t, the group is not assigned a velocity any more when the time step is larger than time_end.\nWhen boolean_def is t, the group is deformed along with the simulation box, as set by the deform command. This option is the same as that in the bd_group command.\nvel_x, vel_y, and vel_z are velocities assigned to the group along the x, y, and z directions, respectively, in unit of distance unit/time unit. Please find the unit used in PyCAC here.\ntime_start and time_end are the starting and ending time step for the group deformation.\ndisp_l and disp_u are the lower and upper bounds of the group displacement, in unit of the lattice constant set by the lattice command.\nWhen boolean_grad is t, the velocity is assigned to the group gradiently; otherwise the group velocity is applied uniformly and the following options become irrelevant.\nWhen boolean_switch is t, the velocity at grad_ref_u is set as zero while that at grad_ref_l is at the maximum; otherwise, the velocity at grad_ref_l is set as zero. Note that grad_ref_l and grad_ref_u are the lower and upper bounds of the gradient, in unit of the lattice priodic length.\ngrad_ref_axis is the axis along which the gradient velocity is based on. For example, in the third example, grad_ref_axis = 2 and boolean_switch is true, then in this group, the elements/nodes/atoms which are located lower than 50. along the y axis are assigned a velocity equalling the vector vel_x (because grad_vel_axis = 1); those located higher than 60. along the y axis are assigned a zero velocity; those between 50. and 60. along the y axis are assigned a linearly varying velocity between zero and vel_x, depending on their locations with respect to the \nRelated commands\nThe name_of_group in the cal command must match that in the current command.\nThe name_of_group of groups defined in the bd_group command are name_#, where # is an integer equallying number_of_new_group + number_of_restart_group + 1, 2, 3 ...\nRelated files\ngroup.f90\nDefault\nNone.\n"},"chapter5/lattice.html":{"url":"chapter5/lattice.html","title":"lattice","keywords":"","body":"lattice\nSyntax\nboundary x y z\n\nx,y,z = p or s or f\n  p is periodic\n  f is non-periodic and fixed\n  s is non-periodic and shrink-wrapped\n\n\nExamples\nboundary p f s\nDescription\nSet the style of boundaries for the global simulation box in each dimension.
