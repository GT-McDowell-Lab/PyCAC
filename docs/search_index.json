A CAC simulation model, in general, partitions the simulation cell into two domains: a coarse-grained domain and an atomistic domain. Distinct from most concurrent multiscale methods in the literature, CAC employs a unified atomistic-continuum integral formulation with elements that have discontinuities between them; also, the underlying interatomic potential is the only constitutive relation in the system. As such, CAC admits propagation of displacement discontinuities (dislocations and associated intrinsic stacking faults) through a lattice in both atomistic and coarse-grained domains, as shown in the figure below.\nFigure 1. A 2-D CAC simulation domain consisting of an atomistic domain (right) and a coarse-grained domain (left) (Xu et al.). The atomistic domain is composed of atoms (black circles), which follow the same governing equations in the atomistic simulation. The coarse-grained domain consists of discontinuous elements of varying size, each of which contains a large number of underlying atoms with the nodes (red circles) as the only degrees of freedom. Only the force/energy on integration points (green circles) and nodes are calculated. In (a), an edge dislocation (red ⊥\\perp⊥) is located in the atomistic domain. Upon applying a shear stress on the simulation cell, the dislocation migrates into the coarse-grained domain in (b), where the Burgers vector spreads out between discontinuous elements.\n\n\nFigure 2. In 3-D, elements have faces on {111} planes and {110} planes in an FCC and a BCC lattice, resepectively. The positions of atoms within each element (open circles) are interpolated from the nodal positions (red filled circles).\n\n\nIn a (big) nutshell, CAC\n\ndescribes certain lattice defects and their interactions using fully resolved atomistics;\npreserves the net Burgers vector and associated long range stress fields of curved, mixed character dislocations in a sufficiently large continuum domain in a fully 3D model;\nemploys the same governing equations and interatomic potentials in both domains to avoid the usage of phenomenological parameters, essential remeshing operations and ad hoc procedures for passing dislocation segments between the atomistic and coarse-grained domains.\n\n"},"chapter1/pycac-feature.html":{"url":"chapter1/pycac-feature.html","title":"PyCAC features and non-features","keywords":"","body":"PyCAC features and non-features\nFeatures\nThe PyCAC code can simulate monatomic pure face-centered cubic (FCC) or pure body-centered cubic (BCC) metals using the Lennard-Jones (LJ) or the embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials in a constant temperature field.

Some functions in MPI-3 standard are employed. It works with Open MPI version 2.1, Intel MPI version 5.1, MPICH version 3.3, and MVAPICH2 version 2.3.\nFortran compiler\nSome intrinsic functions in Fortran 2008 is employed in the code, so compilers that fully support Fortran 2008 are preferred. For example, GNU Fortran version 7.0 and Intel Fortran version 17.0 work with the PyCAC code.\nTo compile the code, simply run the install.sh file in the PyCAC code package, i.e.,\n./install.sh\nNote that the compilation process has not been tested on Microsoft Windows. On macOS, a message\n/opt/local/bin/ranlib: file: libcac.a(constant_para_module.o) has no symbols\nmay occur. The users are suggested to compile and run the PyCAC code on Linux, which dominates the high performance computing systems.\nCompilation\nModule\nIn compilation, the first step is to create a static library libcac.a from the 56 module files *_module.f90 in the module directory. There are five types of module files:\n*_comm_module.f90\nThere is only one *_comm_module.f90 file: precision_comm_module.f90. It controls the precision of the integer and real numbers.\n*_para_module.f90\nThere are 25 *_para_module.f90 files. They define single value variables that may be used globally.\n*_array_module.f90\nThere are 24 *_array_module.f90 files. They define arrays that may be used globally. With a few exceptions, the *_para_module.f90 and *_array_module.f90 files come in pairs.\n*_function_module.f90\nThere are 5 *_function_module.f90 files. They define interatomic potential formulations, arithmetic/linear algebra calculations, unit conversion, etc.\n*_tab_module.f90\nThere is only one *_tab_module.f90 file: eam_tab_module.f90. It contains algorithms that extract the EAM potential-based values from numerical tables.\nNote that these module files should be compiled in this order (see that the install.sh file) in creating the static library libcac.a. Otherwise, an error may occur.\nSubroutine\nThen, an executable, named CAC, is compiled using one main program (main.f90) plus 175 subroutines (*.f90) in the src directory and linked with the static library libcac.a.\nExecution\nIn execution, the executable CAC, the input file cac.in, and the potential files are moved into the same directory. It follows that\nmpirun -np num_of_proc ./CAC where positive integer num_of_proc is the number of processors to be used. As an example, see the run.sh file in the PyCAC code package.\nThe users may run the PyCAC code on the MATerials Innovation Network (MATIN) at Georgia Tech. Instructions will be added later.\n"},"chapter1/matin.html":{"url":"chapter1/matin.html","title":"Running PyCAC on MATIN","keywords":"","body":"Running PyCAC on MATIN\nThe users may run the PyCAC code on the MATerials Innovation Network (MATIN) at Georgia Tech.

It employs the two-level structural description of all crystals in solid state physics, i.e., the well known equation of \"crystal structure = lattice + basis\" [4]. As a result of the bottom-up atomistic formulation, all the essential atomistic information of the material, including the crystal structure and the interaction between atoms, are built in the formulation. A schematic of micromorphic theory and AFT is given below.\nMacro- and micro-motions of a material particle P in (a) micromorphic theory and (b) AFT.

Because of its current features, only the first two governing equations are explicitly implemented into PyCAC.  Employing the classical definition of kinetic temperature, which is proportional to the kinetic part of the atomistic stress, the linear momentum equations can be expressed in a form that involves the internal force density fintα\\mathbf{f}_\\mathrm{int}^\\alphaf​int​α​​ and temperature TTT [5-7],\nραu¨α+γαkBΔV∇xT=fintα+fextα,α=1,2,…,Na\\rho^\\alpha \\ddot{\\mathbf{u}}^\\alpha + \\frac{\\gamma^\\alpha k_\\mathrm{B}}{\\Delta V} \\nabla_\\mathbf{x} T = \\mathbf{f}_\\mathrm{int}^\\alpha + \\mathbf{f}_\\mathrm{ext}^\\alpha, \\quad \\alpha = 1, 2, \\ldots, N_aρ​α​​​u​¨​​​α​​+​ΔV​​γ​α​​k​B​​​​∇​x​​T=f​int​α​​+f​ext​α​​,α=1,2,…,N​a​​\nwhere uα\\mathbf{u}^\\alphau​α​​ is the displacement of the α\\alphaαth atom at point x\\mathbf{x}x; the superposed dots denote the material time derivative; ΔV\\Delta VΔV is the volume of the finite-sized material particle (the primitive unit cell for crystalline materials) at x\\mathbf{x}x; kBk_\\mathrm{B}k​B​​ is the Boltzmann constant; γα=mα/∑α=1Namα\\gamma^\\alpha = m^\\alpha / \\sum^{N_a}_{\\alpha = 1} m^\\alphaγ​α​​=m​α​​/∑​α=1​N​a​​​​m​α​​, and fintα\\mathbf{f}_\\mathrm{int}^\\alphaf​int​α​​ is the internal force density and is a nonlinear nonlocal function of relative atomic displacements. \nFor systems with a constant temperature field or a constant temperature gradient, the temperature term has the effect of a surface traction on the boundary or a body force in the interior of the material [6]. Denoting the temperature term in the above equation as fTα(x)\\mathbf{f}_\\mathrm{T}^\\alpha(\\mathbf{x})f​T​α​​(x) and the finite element shape function as Φξ(x)\\Phi_\\xi(\\mathbf{x})Φ​ξ​​(x), the Galerkin weak form of the above equation can be written as\n∫Ω(x)Φξ(x)(ραu¨α(x)+fTα(x)−fintα(x)−fextα(x))dx=0\\int_{\\Omega(\\mathbf{x})} \\Phi_\\xi(\\mathbf{x}) (\\rho^\\alpha \\ddot{\\mathbf{u}}^\\alpha(\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{f}_\\mathrm{T}^\\alpha(\\mathbf{x}) - \\mathbf{f}_\\mathrm{int}^\\alpha(\\mathbf{x}) - \\mathbf{f}_\\mathrm{ext}^\\alpha(\\mathbf{x})) \\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{x} = 0∫​Ω(x)​​Φ​ξ​​(x)(ρ​α​​​u​¨​​​α​​(x)+f​T​α​​(x)−f​int​α​​(x)−f​ext​α​​(x))dx=0\nwhere Ω(x)\\Omega(\\mathbf{x})Ω(x) is the simulation domain; the integrals can be evaluated using numerical integration methods such as Gaussian quadrature, leading to a set of discretized governing equations with the finite element nodal displacements as the unknowns to be solved. Note that in PyCAC, the fTα(x)\\mathbf{f}_\\mathrm{T}^\\alpha(\\mathbf{x})f​T​α​​(x) term has not yet been implemented as (i) the effect on mechanical properties in a constant temperature field is small and (ii) work is underway to compare different descriptions of temperature in the coarse-grained domain.\nThe accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the CAC simulator are then determined by the two approximations: the shape function and the numerical integration. Simulation results can be displayed in terms of finite elements, which can also be mapped back to atomic positions and be used to plot the atomic trajectories. With the only constitutive relation being the nonlocal atomic force-displacement relation, continuity between elements in the usual finite element method is not required. Consequently, nucleation and propagation of dislocations and/or cracks can be simulated via sliding and separation between finite elements.\nAFT and the equilibrium ensembles\nThe local densities defined in the Irving and Kirkwood formulations are ensemble averaged point functions. The ensemble averaging was described by Irving and Kirkwood as \"repeating the observations many times\" [3]. In the early version of the AFT formulation [1], the local densities were also defined as ensemble averages and hence the governing equations were written in terms of ensemble-averaged local densities. In the later version of the AFT formulation [2],   the local densities are instantaneous quantities, according to argument by Evan and Morris [8], who wrote \"…\\ldots… the reason for considering instantaneous expressions is two-fold. The fluxes are based upon conservation laws and these laws are valid instantaneously for every member of the ensemble. They do not require ensemble averaging to be true. Secondly, most computer simulation involves calculating system properties from a single system trajectory. Ensemble averaging is almost never used because it is relatively expensive in computer time\".\nNote that the AFT local densities and governing equations were derived as an extension of the Irving and Kirkwood's formulation of the equations of hydrodynamics. Consequently, they differ from other statistical mechanical formulations that follow the Gibbs' equilibrium statistical theory of ensembles. Popular equilibrium ensembles include (i) the microcanonical ensemble, which describes a systems isolated from its surroundings and governed by Hamilton's equations of motion (NVE), (ii) the canonical ensemble, which describe a system in constant contact with a heat bath of constant temperature (NVT), and (iii) the isothermal-isobaric ensembles, which describes systems in contact with a thermostat at temperature TTT and a barostat at pressure PPP (NPT) [9]. These ensembles, known as equilibrium ensembles and allowing a wide variety of thermodynamic and structural properties of systems to be computed, can be realized in dynamic CAC, in which a constant temperature is kept via a Langevin thermostat while a constant pressure is maintained via a Berendsen barostat.\nReferences\n\nYouping Chen, James Lee.

The formulation of the CAC balance equations, originally referred to as an atomic micromorphic theory or atomistic field theory (AFT) by Youping Chen and James D. Lee [1,3-8], is an extension of the Irving Kirkwood's formulation of \"the hydrodynamics equations for a single component, single phase system\" [9] to a two-level structural description of crystalline materials. The CAC formulation differs from that of classical continuum mechanics in that it employs a two-level structural description of materials. It is also distinct from the well-established theories of generalized continuum mechanics such as the Cosserat theory [10], micropolar theory [11,12], and micromorphic theory [13,14] in that the sub-level structural description is not continuous but discrete.\nThe first version of the CAC numerical tool was developed by Liming Xiong (Ph.D. 2011) and Qian Deng (Ph.D. 2011). The reformulated balance equations were numerically implemented using FE method with trilinear FE shape functions and nodal integration, and the simulation tool was demonstrated to be able to capture the phenomenon of phase transition in Si [15] and the dynamic processes of fracture, including crack initiation, propagation and branching (Fig. 1) [16,17].  \nFigure 1. Time sequence of CAC simulations of a brittle material (2.24 μm\\mu\\mathrm{m}μm by 1.4 μm\\mu\\mathrm{m}μm) showing (a) stress waves emitting from a propagating crack; (b) and (c) crack branching as a result of the interactions between waves propagating from the crack tip and those reflected from the specimen boundaries [17].\n\n\nThe form and capabilities of the CAC method were extended substantially as a direct result of collaborative efforts between University of Florida and Georgia Tech in modeling and simulations of the dynamics of dislocations: elements that have discontinuities between them were employed, and the Gaussian quadrature was used for integration in the coarse-grained domain. Nucleation and propagation of dislocations in the coarse-grained domain [18,19], passing dislocations from the atomistic domain to the coarse-grained domain [20], the growth of dislocation loops in Cu, Al and Si (Fig. 2(a)) [21], fast moving dislocations (Fig. 2(b)) [22], and other progresses [23-26], have been successfully simulated without special numerical treatment or supplemental constitutive relations. The name \"CAC\" for the methodology was coined by David L. McDowell in 2010.\nFigure 2. (a) CAC simulation results of the nucleation and growth of dislocation loops in Cu, Al, Si [21]. (b) Time sequences of dislocation motions in MD and fully coarse-grained CAC simulations [22].\n\n\nThe CAC code was rewritten using Fortran 90 by Shengfeng Yang (Ph.D. 2014) for multiscale simulation of polycrystalline ionic materials. This is the second-generation of the CAC code. It employs the Wolf method to calculate the long-range Columbic force and a special type of element (i.e., an incomplete element) to model regions with defects such as grain boundaries (GBs) in polyatomic materials. This version of the CAC code enables multiple meshing resolutions and simulation of two or more materials (e.g., Si and Ge), with multiple types of interatomic potentials, including the Buckingham and the Stillinger-Weber potentials. The CAC code was demonstrated to reproduce the equilibrium structures and energies of GBs in SrTiO3_3​3​​, in good agreement with those obtained from existing experiments and density functional theory calculations. The code has been used to study the dynamic processes of crack initiation as well as the evolution of dislocation in single crystalline [27], bicrytalline [28], and polycrystalline SrTiO3_3​3​​ (Fig. 3) [29,30].\nFigure 3. (a) A CAC model of polycrystalline SrTiO3_3​3​​ (2D view) in which the GBs are modeled with atomic resolution and the grains with coarse-scale finite elements; (b) Central symmetry parameter plot of the deformed model showing the nucleation and propagation of many dislocations and their interactions with the GBs; The comparison between (c) CAC and (d) MD simulation results is shown at strain 8.7% [30].\n\n\nThe CAC code was also rewritten by Shuozhi Xu (Ph.D. 2016) using Fortran 2008. The code was optimized and the efficiency was significantly improved. The code includes the quasistatic version of CAC to carry out quasistatic simulations so as to obtain energy minimized atomic and nodal structures, in addition to dynamic simulations. Equipped with the Python scripting interface written by Thomas G. Payne, this version of code, termed PyCAC, has been well tested for ductile fracture [31], quasistatic dislocation migration [32], screw dislocation cross-slip [33], edge dislocations bowing out from obstacles [34], dislocation multiplication from Frank-Read sources [35], dislocation/stacking fault interactions [36], and dislocation/GB interactions (Fig. 4) [37,38].\nFigure 4. Snapshots of dislocation pile-up with dominant leading screw character impinging against a Σ3\\Sigma 3Σ3{111} coherent twin boundary (CTB) [38]. In (a), five incoming dislocations approach the CTB subject to an applied shear stress. In (b), the leading dislocation is constricted at the CTB, where two Shockley partial dislocations are recombined into a full dislocation. In (c), with certain interatomic potentials, the dislocation effectively cross-slips into the outgoing twinned grain via redissociation into two partials. In (d), with different potentials, the redissociated dislocation is absorbed by the CTB, with two partials gliding on the twin plane in opposite directions.\n\n\nBased on the Fortran 90 code, Xiang Chen (Ph.D. 2016) extended the CAC method for space- and time-resolved simulation of the transient processes of the propagation of heat pulses in single crystals and across GBs [39] as well as the interactions between heat pulses and moving dislocations (Fig. 5) [40]. A phonon representation of the heat pulses, termed a coherent phonon pulse model [41], was created to mimic the coherent lattice excitation achieved via ultrashort laser pulses, and was incorporated into the framework of CAC to provide a coupled treatment for defect dynamics and phonon thermal transport. A first attempt was made to pass full phonon spectrum from the atomistic domain to the coarse-grained domain by introducing a wave-based interpolation scheme [42].\nFigure 5. Normalized kinetic energy distribution in simulations of the propagation of dislocations and a heat pulse: (a-c) a moving dislocation before meeting a heat pulse, showing that the motion of the dislocation is accompanied by radial-shaped wavefronts of phonons ahead of the moving dislocation and V-shaped wave tails in the wake of the dislocation; (d) the dislocation meeting with a propagating heat pulse; (e-f) an array of moving dislocations meeting with the heat pulse showing partially coherent partially diffuse scattering of the phonons by the moving dislocations [40].\n\n\nThe groups of Profs. McDowell, Chen, and Xiong are still actively advancing the CAC method. Keep an eye on the CAC publications for the latest progress!\nReferences\n\nYouping Chen, James Lee.

In CAC, the simulation cell has nonuniformly distributed integration points (in the coarse-grained domain) and atoms (in the atomistic domain), such that the workload is poorly balanced if one assigns each processor an equally-sized cubic domain as in full atomistics. This workload balance issue is not unique to CAC, but is also encountered by other concurrent multiscale modeling methods.\nThe PyCAC code employs the SD algorithm in which the load balance is optimized.

In CAC simulations, all stress components are usually small at the beginning. Subject to the strain, most stress tensor components increase in magnitude until one of them is higher than the corresponding stress_u, at which point the strain rate tensor changes sign, i.e., the deformation is reversed but each ij remains unchanged. Subject to the newly reversed strain, most stress tensor components decrease until one of them is lower than the corresponding stress_l, in which case the strain rate tensor changes sign again, i.e., the deformation is applied as the initial setting. Whether the stress component is out of bounds is monitored not at every step, but at every flip_frequency step.\nThe deformation begins when the simulation step equals time_start and stops when it exceeds time_end.\nWhen (i) the simulation step is larger than time_always_flip and (ii) the simulation step does not exceed time_end and (iii) the strain rate tensor did not change sign previously, the strain rate tensor changes sign at every step, regardless of the stress bounds defined by stress_l and stress_u.

The number of fix commands is fix_number. The new groups are created by first providing the elements/nodes/atoms information in the group command, while the same information for the restart groups, which are introduced when restart_group_number > 0, is read from group_in_#.id, where # is a positive integer starting from new_group_number + 1. A group_in_#.id file can be renamed from a group_out_#.id file that was created automatically in previous CAC simulations of which the total number of groups > 0.\nWhen the groups are at the simulation cell boundaries, this command is useful in applying displacement, traction, or mixed boundary conditions.\ngroup_name must match one of the new groups or restart groups. All in this command take effect only when time_start simulation step time_end, unless stated otherwise.\nwhen simulation step > time_end, the group is no longer assigned a displacement/force if boolean_release = t; the group is assigned a displacement/force vector [assign_x, assign_y, assign_z] whose non-null components are zeroed.\nWhen boolean_def = t, the group is deformed along with the simulation box. The deformation-induced displacement is added on top of the assigned displacement/force.\nassign_style = disp or force, meaning that a displacement or force vector [assign_x, assign_y, assign_z], in Angstrom/time_step or eV/Angstrom, is applied to all nodes/atoms in the group at each simulation step, after their interatomic potential-based displacement/force is discarded. If any component of the displacement/force vector is null, no displacement/force is assigned to this component. In the first example, group_1 is fixed along the xxx and zzz directions but not along the yyy direction.\ndisp_lim is the upper bound of the magnitude of the total group displacement, in units of lattice_constant. If the total displacement magnitude (in Angstrom instead of in Angstrom/time_step) is larger than disp_lim, the displacement vector is zeroed, regardless of whether time_end is reached or what value boolean_release is. disp_lim is irrelevant when assign_style = force. However, it needs to be provided regardless.\nWhen boolean_grad = f, the same displacement/force vector [assign_x, assign_y, assign_z] is assigned to all nodes/atoms of the group; the following options, including grad_ref_axis, grad_assign_axis, grad_ref_l, and grad_ref_u, become irrelevant and do not need to provided.\nWhen boolean_grad = t, the displacement/force is assigned to the group gradiently, i.e., different elements/nodes/atoms in the group may have a different [assign_x, assign_y, assign_z] vector. The grad_assign_axis component of the displacement/force vector is linearly applied to the group based on the positions of elements/nodes/atoms along the grad_ref_axis direction. grad_ref_l and grad_ref_u are the bounds of the graded displacement/force, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the grad_ref_axis direction, with inf referring to the lower (grad_ref_l) and upper (grad_ref_u) simulation cell boundaries.\nIf grad_ref_l grad_ref_u, the elements/nodes/atoms located at or below grad_ref_l are assigned a zero displacement/force vector, i.e., fixed; those located at or above grad_ref_u are assigned [assign_x, assign_y, assign_z]. If grad_ref_l > grad_ref_u, the elements/nodes/atoms located at or above grad_ref_l are assigned a zero displacement/force vector, i.e., fixed; those located at or below grad_ref_u are assigned [assign_x, assign_y, assign_z]. In any case, the elements/nodes/atoms located between grad_ref_l and grad_ref_u are assigned a vector whose grad_assign_axis component is linearly graded while the other two components remain the same with respect to [assign_x, assign_y, assign_z].\nIn the second example, the elements/nodes/atoms which are located below 50.0⋅l′⃗0[2]50.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[2]50.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[2] along the y axis (because grad_ref_axis = 2) are assigned a zero displacement vector; those located above 60.0⋅l′⃗0[2]60.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[2]60.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[2] along the y axis are assigned [assign_x, assign_y, assign_z]; those in between are assigned a linearly graded displacement vector whose x component (because grad_assign_axis = 1) is varied between zero and assign_x while its y and z components are assign_y and assign_z, respectively.\nIn the third example, the elements/nodes/atoms which are located below 10.0⋅l′⃗0[3]10.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[3]10.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[3] along the z axis (because grad_ref_axis = 3) are assigned [assign_x, assign_y, assign_z]; those located above 100.0⋅l′⃗0[3]100.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[3]100.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[3] along the z axis are assigned a zero force vector; those in between are assigned a linearly graded force vector whose y component (because grad_assign_axis = 2) is varied between zero and assign_y while its x and z components are assign_x and assign_z, respectively.\nNote that for each group concerned in this command, the displacement and force vectors are added to relevant nodes/atoms after their interatomic potential-based displacement/force vectored are zeroed. In particular, the force, stress, and energy are zeroed if assign_style = disp; the force, stress, and energy are replaced with those induced by this command if assign_style = force. In both cases, the velocity vectors are also zeroed in dynamic and hybrid CAC.\nIn this sense, if the same atoms/nodes are included in multiple groups that are also concerned in this command, those appearing in the later fix commands will provail. For example, if a node is assigned a displacement vector in the first fix command, a force vector in the second fix command, and another force vector in the third fix command, the force vector in the last fix command will be imposed. As another example, if an atom is assigned a force vector in the fourth fix command, and a displacement vector in the fifth fix command, the force/stress/energy vector of that atom will be zeroed. To avoid unintended effects, users are advised to carefully check if the same nodes/atoms are involved in different fix commands.\nRelated commands\nThere cannot be fewer fix commands than fix_number, which should not be larger than new_group_number + restart_group_number. When there are more fix commands in cac.in than fix_number, those appearing later will be ignored.\nNote that all groups do not necessarily have corresponding fix command. The purpose of having a group that does not have a correpsonding fix command is to calculate certain mechanical properties, e.g., energy, force, and stress, of the nodes/atoms it contains.\nRelated files\nfix.f90, fix_displacement.f90, and fix_force.f90\nDefault\nNone.\n"},"chapter5/grain_dir.html":{"url":"chapter5/grain_dir.html","title":"grain_dir","keywords":"","body":"grain_dir\nSyntax\ngrain_dir direction overlap\n\ndirection = 1 or 2 or 3\n\noverlap = real number\n\n\nExamples\ngrain_dir 1 0.1\ngrain_dir 2 0.2\nDescription\nThis command sets the grain stack direction and the overlap between adjacent grains along that direction, as shown in the figure below:\n\ndirection can be 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to the x, y, or z directions, respectively.\noverlap, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the direction, sets the overlap distance between adjacent grains along the direction, as shown in the figure above.

The elements/nodes/atoms in a group, either a new group or a restar group, can be moved at each simulation step, deformed with the simulation cell (when boolean_def in both fix and deform commands = t), or not moved/deformed. The syntax is similar to the first of that of the modify command.\nMultiple groups cannot have the same group_name.\nstyle_cg decides whether the group contains elements (element), nodes (node), or nothing (null) in the coarse-grained domain; the differences between element and node are discussed here. style_at decides whether the group contains atoms (atom) or nothing (null) in the atomistic domain.\nThere are currently five group_shape: block, cylinder, cone, tube, and sphere.\nlower_b and upper_b are the lower and upper boundaries of the group_shape, respectively, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the corresponding direction. When lower_b or upper_b = inf, the corresponding lower or upper simulation cell boundaries are taken as the group_shape boundaries, respectively. Note that when group_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, lower_b and upper_b are the lower and upper plane boundaries normal to the central axis group_axis direction, respectively.\ni, j, and k decide the group_shape (≠\\neq≠ sphere) boundary plane orientations with respect to the simulation cell, similar to those in the box_dir command.\nNote that these five options (lower_b, upper_b, i, j, and k) are irrelevant when group_shape = sphere, and when group_shape = cylinder or cone or tube if the corresponding direction is not group_axis. Also, group_axis is irrelevant when group_shape = block or sphere. However, they need to be provided regardless.\nWhen boolean_in = t, elements/nodes/atoms inside the group_shape belong to the group; otherwise, those outside do.\ngroup_centroid_x, group_centroid_y, and group_centroid_z, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ and with respect to the lower boundaries of the simulation cell along the corresponding direction, are the coordinates of the center of the base plane of a cylinder or cone or tube, or the center of a sphere. When group_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, the group_centroid_* that corresponds to the group_axis direction becomes irrelevant. For example, when group_axis = 2, group_centroid_y can take any real number without affecting the results.\ngroup_radius_large is the base radius of a cylinder, the large base radius of a cone, the outer base radius of a tube, or the radius of a sphere. group_radius_small, the small base radius of a cone or the inner base radius of a tube, is irrelevant for other group_shape. Both group_radius_large and group_radius_small are in units of the maximum lattice periodicity length lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​.\nNote that these six options (group_axis, group_centroid_*, and group_radius_*) are not relevant when group_shape = block. Yet, they need to be provided regardless.\nRelated commands\nThere cannot be fewer group commands than new_group_number. When there are too many group commands, those appearing later will be ignored.

Once the direction is set, the inner iterations begin in which a line search is conducted to determine the length by which the nodes/atoms need to move along the designated direction to find the minimized energy. For more information of the energy minimization with these two styles, read chapter 3 of Shuozhi Xu's Ph.D. dissertation.\nThe fire style is based on Bitzek et al., 2006 while the qm style is based on quenched dynamics which is used also in dynamic CAC. The difference is that only one quenched dynamics iteration is carried out at each simulation step in dynamic CAC while many quenched dynamics iterations are performed at each simulation step during the energy minimization until the internal energy converges at that step. For the fire and qm styles, the inner iteration is irrelevant.\nThe energy minimization is considered to converge when either the number of outer iterations reaches max_iteraction or the energy variation between successive outer iterations divided by the energy of the current iteration is less than tolerance.\nRelated commands\nThis command is relevant only when simulation_style = statics or hybrid.\nRelated files\nquasi_statics.f90, mini_init.f90, update_mini.f90, mini_energy.f90, hybrid.f90, conjugate_gradient.f90, steepest_descent.f90, quick_mini.f90, and fire.f90\nDefault\nminimize cg 1000 1d-6\n"},"chapter5/modify_num.html":{"url":"chapter5/modify_num.html","title":"modify_num","keywords":"","body":"modify_num\nSyntax\nmodify_num modify_number\n\nmodify_number = non-negative integer (\n\nExamples\nmodify_num 2\nDescription\nThis command sets the number of modifications that are made to the elements/nodes/atoms that are built from scratch, i.e., when boolean_restart = f.\nRelated commands\nThe modification style is set by the modify command.\nThis command becomes irrelevant when boolean_restart = t, in which case there is no need for the modification information.\nRelated files\nmodel_modify.f90\nDefault\nmodify_num 0\n"},"chapter5/modify.html":{"url":"chapter5/modify.html","title":"modify","keywords":"","body":"modify\nSyntax\nmodify modify_name modify_style modify_shape\n       x lower_b upper_b i j k\n       y lower_b upper_b i j k\n       z lower_b upper_b i j k\n       boolean_in boolean_delete_filled modify_axis\n       modify_centroid_x modify_centroid_y modify_centroid_z\n       modify_radius_large modify_radius_small\n\nmodify modify_name modify_style line_axis plane_axis\n       modify_centroid_x modify_centroid_y modify_centroid_z\n       dis_angle poisson_ratio\n\nmodify modify_name modify_style depth tolerance\n\nmodify_name = a string (length \n\nmodify_style = delete or cg2at or cutoff\n\nmodify_shape = block or cylinder or cone or tube or sphere\n\nlower_b, upper_b = real number or inf\n\ni, j, k = real number\n\nboolean_in, boolean_delete_filled = t or f\n  t is true\n  f is false\n\nmodify_axis, line_axis, plane_axis = 1 or 2 or 3\n\nmodify_centroid_x, modify_centroid_y, modify_centroid_z, dis_angle, poisson_ratio = real number\n\nmodify_radius_large, modify_radius_small, depth, tolerance = positive real number\n\n\nExamples\nmodify modify_1 delete cylinder x 0. 1. 0.94281 0. -0.33333 y inf inf 0. 1. 0. z inf inf 0. 0. 1. t t 3 50. 50. 1. 2. 5.\nmodify modify_2 cg2at block x inf inf 1. 0. 0. y 1. 12. 0. 0.94281 -0.33333 z inf inf 0. 0. 1. t f 1 20. 4. 5. 17. 13.\nmodify modify_3 dislocation 1 3 1. 20. 3.2 60. 0.36\nmodify modify_4 cutoff 0.1 0.01\nDescription\nThis command sets the modifications made to the elements/nodes/atoms that are built from scratch, i.e., when boolean_restart = f. The first syntax is similar to that of the group command.\nThere are currently four modify_style: delete, cg2at, dislocation, and cutoff. When modify_style = delete or cg2at, the first syntax is used; when modify_style = dislocation, the second syntax is used; otherwise, the third syntax is used.\nFirst syntax (modify_style = delete or cg2at)\nThe first syntax removes some elements/atoms (delete) or refines some elements into atomic scale (cg2at), based on the simulation cell built from scratch.\nThere are five modify_shape: block, cylinder, cone, tube, and sphere.\nlower_b and upper_b are the lower and upper boundaries of the modify_shape, respectively, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the corresponding direction. When lower_b or upper_b = inf, the corresponding lower or upper simulation cell boundaries are taken as the modify_shape boundaries, respectively. Note that when modify_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, lower_b and upper_b are the lower and upper plane boundaries normal to the central axis modify_axis direction, respectively.\ni, j, and k decide the modify_shape (≠\\neq≠ sphere) boundary plane orientations with respect to the simulation cell, similar to those in the box_dir command.\nNote that these five options (lower_b, upper_b, i, j, and k) are irrelevant when modify_shape = sphere, and when modify_shape = cylinder or cone or tube if the corresponding direction is not modify_axis. Also, modify_axis is irrelevant when modify_shape = block or sphere. However, they need to be provided regardless.\nWhen boolean_in = t, elements with any of their parts (in the coarse-grained domain) and atoms (in the atomistic domain) inside the modify_shape are deleted (delete) or refined to atomic scale (cg2at); otherwise, those outside are. In the coarse-grained domain, an element might have some part  of it inside and the remaining part outside modify_shape; for this element, with delete, the region that is left behind due to the deletion may not have the shape specified by modify_shape. In this case, if boolean_delete_filled = t, atoms (that are linearly interpolated from the original element) will be filled in to maintain the modify_shape. E.g., if boolean_in = t, the interpolated atoms of the deleted elements that are outside modify_shape are filled in; otherwise, those inside are, as shown in the figure below. Note that boolean_delete_filled is irrelevant when modify_style = cg2at.\n\nAlso note that while delete applies to both atomistic and coarse-grained domains, cg2at applied to the coarse-grained domain only. Different from the group command in which the user should pay attention to the difference between element and node, a modification follows one simple rule in the coarse-grained domain: an element and all its nodes are selected if any interpolated atom of this element is inside (if boolean_in = t) or outside (if boolean_in = f) modify_shape.\nmodify_centroid_x, modify_centroid_y, and modify_centroid_z, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ and with respect to the lower boundaries of the simulation cell along the corresponding direction, are the coordinates of the center of the base plane of a cylinder or cone or tube, or the center of a sphere. When modify_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, the modify_centroid_* that corresponds to the modify_axis becomes irrelevant. For example, when modify_axis = 3, modify_centroid_z can take any real number without affecting the results.\nmodify_radius_large is the base radius of a cylinder, the large base radius of a cone, the outer base radius of a tube, or the radius of a sphere. modify_radius_small, the small base radius of a cone or the inner base radius of a tube, is irrelevant for other modify_shape. Both modify_radius_large and modify_radius_small are in units of the maximum lattice periodicity length lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​.\nNote that these six options (modify_axis, modify_centroid_*, and modify_radius_*) are not relevant when modify_shape = block. Yet, they need to be provided regardless.\nSecond syntax (modify_style = dislocation)\nThe second syntax builds a full dislocation into the simulation cell, with nodes/atoms displaced following the isotropic displacement field. In FCC and BCC lattices, a full dislocation has a Burgers vector magnitude of (2/2)a0(\\sqrt{2}/2)a_0(√​2​​​/2)a​0​​ and (3/2)a0(\\sqrt{3}/2)a_0(√​3​​​/2)a​0​​, respectively, where a0a_0a​0​​ is the lattice_constant. Multiple modify commands with modify_style = dislocation can be employed to introduce multiple dislocations.\nline_axis and plane_axis are the dislocation line axis and the plane normal axis, respectively. They cannot be the same.\nmodify_centroid_x, modify_centroid_y, and modify_centroid_z, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ and with respect to the lower boundaries of the simulation cell along the corresponding direction, are the coordinates of the origin with respect to which the displacement field is built. For example, if one wants to build a dislocation passing through the centroid of the simulation cell, these three quantities should be at the centroid. Note that in the coarse-grained and atomistic domains, the slip plane, which contains the dislocation along line_axis and has a normal direction plane_axis, should be located between two adjacent elements and two atomic layers, respectively.\ndis_angle and poisson_ratio are the dislcoation character angle (in degrees) and the isotropic Poisson's ratio of the material, respectively.\nThird syntax (modify_style = cutoff)\nThe third syntax deletes one atom from a pair of atoms (either real atoms in the atomistic domain or interpolated atoms in the coarse-grained domain) when they are too close, at the grain boundary. The situation that some atoms are too close to each other is usually a result of the overlap or grain origin displacements. Among all modify commands, there should be no more than one with modify_style = cutoff.\ndepth and tolerance, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the grain stack direction, specify the size of the target region and the cutoff distance, respectively, as shown in the figure below. In most cases, tolerance should not be larger than or equal to the first nearest neighbor distance in a perfect lattice.\n\nAt each grain boundary, a check is first conducted, within the region set by depth along the grain stack direction, on both the real atoms in the atomistic domain or the interpolated atoms in the coarse-grained doain. In the figure above, (i) all atoms in the red shaded region (grain I) will be run against those in the left green shaded region (grain II), (ii) all atoms in the right green shaded region (grain II) will be run against those in the blue shaded region (grain III). Within a pair, if both are real atoms, the one associated with a smaller grain_id is deleted; if one is a real atom and the other is an interpolated atom, the real atom is deleted; if both are interpolated atoms, the user will get an error message because it is impossible to delete a single interpolated atom from an element, which would violate the hyperelastic body assumption of an element.\nRelated commands\nThere cannot be fewer modify commands than modify_number. When there are too many modify commands in cac.in, those appearing later will be ignored.\nThis command becomes irrelevant when boolean_restart = t or modify_number = 0, in which case there is no need for the modification information.\nRelated files\nmodel_modify.f90, model_modify_interpo.f90, model_cutoff.f90, model_cutoff_bd.f90, model_dislocation.f90, model_cg2at.f90, model_delete.f90, and model_rearrange.f90.\nDefault\nNone.\nAcknowledgements\nJi Rigelesaiyin and Jaber R.

On the other hand, flat boundaries are sometimes desirable to enforce the periodic boundary conditions or to lower the aphysical stress concentrations at the boundaries.\nIf one of the three booleans in this command is f, atoms will be filled in the corresponding jagged interstices, resulting in flat boundaries normal to the corresponding direction, unless the boundaries were already flat with rhomboheral elements, e.g., parallel to a {111} plane in an FCC lattice or to a {110} plane in a BCC lattice.

For example, when [abc]=[112][abc] = [112][abc]=[112], a2+b2+c2a0=6a0\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}a_0 = \\sqrt{6}a_0√​a​2​​+b​2​​+c​2​​​​​a​0​​=√​6​​​a​0​​, yet the smallest lattice periodicity length l0=(6/2)a0l_0 = (\\sqrt{6}/2)a_0l​0​​=(√​6​​​/2)a​0​​.\nSo how is l0l_0l​0​​ calculated for any given [abc][abc][abc]? First, one calculates l=a2+b2+c2l = a^2 + b^2 + c^2l=a​2​​+b​2​​+c​2​​. Second, one divides lll by 2, then by 2 again, and so on, until the result is not divisable by 2. For example, if l=24l = 24l=24, one gets 24/2=1224/2 = 1224/2=12, then 12/2=612/2 = 612/2=6, then 6/2=36/2 = 36/2=3, then 333 is not divisible by 2. During this process, lll and its quotients are divided by 2 for 3 times, then one get an integer Δ=3\\Delta = 3Δ=3. Finally, l0=(l/Δ)a0l_0 = (\\sqrt{l}/\\Delta)a_0l​0​​=(√​l​​​/Δ)a​0​​. Repeating this process for the remaining orientations results in the lattice periodicity length vector l⃗0\\vec{l}_0​l​⃗​​​0​​.\nSince each grain has its own crystallographic orientations, each grain has its own l⃗0\\vec{l}_0​l​⃗​​​0​​. The length vector along each direction that is the largest in magnitude among all grains is the lattice periodicity length for the simulation cell, l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​. The largest component in the l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ vector is the maximum lattice periodicity length for the simulation cell, lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​.\nl′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ and lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​ are the distant units in four commands: fix, grain_dir, group, and modify.\n"},"chapter8/rank.html":{"url":"chapter8/rank.html","title":"processor rank","keywords":"","body":"processor rank\nIn MPI, rank is a logical way of numbering processors. The processor 1 has rank 0, the processor 2 has rank 1, and so on. In the PyCAC code, the integer root is set to 0 in processor_para_module.f90. The processor 1, i.e., root, does heavy lifting in reading, writing, and collecting data from other processors.\n"},"chapter8/shared-element.html":{"url":"chapter8/shared-element.html","title":"shared elements","keywords":"","body":"shared elements\nOne issue that does not exist in parallel atomistic simulations but requires special attention in par- allel finite element implementations is that in the latter some elements may be shared between neighboring processors. In CAC, this issue originates from the difference in shape between the parallelepipedonal processor domain and the rhombohedral finite elements with arbitrary crystallographic orientations, the latter of which also results in the jagged simulation cell boundaries. Instead of having all relevant processors calculate the same quantities (e.g., force, energy, and virial) within a shared element, in the PyCAC code, each relevant processor only calculates quantities of the integration points its domain contains. Then these quantities are summed in the processor_equiv.f90 subroutine, after which all relevant processors have the same nodal quantities. This simple summation is feasible because of the trilinear shape function employed in the finite elements.\nTo facilitate the shared element-related calculations, a public array tag_shared_ele and a public variable ele_shared_num are introduced. For example, processor 3 has 6 local elements, with the 2nd, 4th, and 5th elements shared with other processors, then\ntag_ele_shared(1) = 0\ntag_ele_shared(2) = 1\ntag_ele_shared(3) = 0\ntag_ele_shared(4) = 2\ntag_ele_shared(5) = 3\ntag_ele_shared(6) = 0\nand\nele_shared_num = 3\nThe array and the variable, defined in processor_scatter_cg.f90 and updated in update_neighbor_cg.f90, are used in these three subroutines: processor_edenshost_intpo.f90, processor_equiv.f90, and processor_langevin_cg.f90.\nNote that in current PyCAC code, the \"shared element communication\" process mentioned above does NOT involve a host processor as described in page 123 of Xu et al., which was for a previous version. The host processor, which has the highest rank among all processors that share the same element, is indeed used in the code, but only for the purposes of (i) sending the element/node information to the root processor for output, e.g., in all_to_one_cg.f90 and all_to_one_group_cg.f90, and (ii) calculating certain variables based on the global arrays, e.g., the global force norm force_norm calculated in conjugate_gradient.f90, fire.f90, langevin_vel.f90, quenched_vel.f90, quick_mini.f90, steepest_descent.f90, and update_vel.f90. For example, when processor 2 and processor 3 share the same element (and thus have the same relevant nodal information), only one of them needs to send the information to root. The host processor is set in the processor_scatter_cg.f90 subroutine, in which the array who_has_ele(ie) = .true. for the host processor and .false. for non-host processors, where ie is the local element id.\n"},"chapter8/eam.html":{"url":"chapter8/eam.html","title":"EAM potential","keywords":"","body":"EAM potential\nAs mentioned earlier, the EAM formulation for the potential energy is\nE=12∑i∑jj≠iVij(rij)+∑iF(ρ¯i)E = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i\\sum_{j \\atop j\\neq i} V_{ij}(r_{ij}) + \\sum_i F(\\bar{\\rho}_i)E=​2​​1​​∑​i​​∑​​j≠i​j​​​​V​ij​​(r​ij​​)+∑​i​​F(​ρ​¯​​​i​​)\nwhere VVV is the pair potential, FFF is the embedding potential, and ρ¯\\bar{\\rho}​ρ​¯​​ is the host electron density, i.e.,\nρ¯i=∑jj≠iρij(rij)\\bar{\\rho}_i = \\sum_{j \\atop j \\neq i} \\rho_{ij}(r_{ij})​ρ​¯​​​i​​=∑​​j≠i​j​​​​ρ​ij​​(r​ij​​)\nwhere ρij\\rho_{ij}ρ​ij​​ is the local electron density contributed by atom jjj at site iii.\nLet rji\\mathbf{r}_{ji}r​ji​​ be the vector from atom jjj to atom iii with norm rji(=rij)r_{ji} (= r_{ij})r​ji​​(=r​ij​​), i.e.,\nrji=ri−rj\\mathbf{r}_{ji} = \\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_jr​ji​​=r​i​​−r​j​​\nrji=(rix−rjx)2+(riy−rjy)2+(riz−rjz)2r_{ji} = \\sqrt{(r_i^x - r_j^x)^2 + (r_i^y - r_j^y)^2 + (r_i^z - r_j^z)^2}r​ji​​=√​(r​i​x​​−r​j​x​​)​2​​+(r​i​y​​−r​j​y​​)​2​​+(r​i​z​​−r​j​z​​)​2​​​​​\nwhere\nrj=rjxex+rjyey+rjzez\\mathbf{r}_j = r_j^x\\mathbf{e}^x + r_j^y\\mathbf{e}^y + r_j^z\\mathbf{e}^zr​j​​=r​j​x​​e​x​​+r​j​y​​e​y​​+r​j​z​​e​z​​\nNow, let's prove an important identity,\n∂rji∂rj=∂rji∂rjxex+∂rji∂rjyey+∂rji∂rjzez=−rjixrjiex−rjiyrjiey−rjizrjiez=−rjirji\\frac{\\partial r_{ji}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_j} = \\frac{\\partial r_{ji}}{\\partial r_j^x} \\mathbf{e}^x + \\frac{\\partial r_{ji}}{\\partial r_j^y} \\mathbf{e}^y + \\frac{\\partial r_{ji}}{\\partial r_j^z} \\mathbf{e}^z =  - \\frac{r_{ji}^x}{r_{ji}} \\mathbf{e}^x - \\frac{r_{ji}^y}{r_{ji}} \\mathbf{e}^y - \\frac{r_{ji}^z}{r_{ji}} \\mathbf{e}^z = -\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{ji}}{r_{ji}}​∂r​j​​​​∂r​ji​​​​=​∂r​j​x​​​​∂r​ji​​​​e​x​​+​∂r​j​y​​​​∂r​ji​​​​e​y​​+​∂r​j​z​​​​∂r​ji​​​​e​z​​=−​r​ji​​​​r​ji​x​​​​e​x​​−​r​ji​​​​r​ji​y​​​​e​y​​−​r​ji​​​​r​ji​z​​​​e​z​​=−​r​ji​​​​r​ji​​​​\nwhich will be used in the force formulation derivation later.\nThe force on atom kkk is\nfk=−∂E∂rk=−12∂∑i∑jj≠iVij(rij)∂rk−∂∑iF(ρ¯i)∂rk\\mathbf{f}_k = -\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial \\sum_i \\sum_{j \\atop j \\neq i}V_{ij}(r_{ij})}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k}-\\frac{\\partial \\sum_i F(\\bar{\\rho}_i)}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k}f​k​​=−​∂r​k​​​​∂E​​=−​2​​1​​​∂r​k​​​​∂∑​i​​∑​​j≠i​j​​​​V​ij​​(r​ij​​)​​−​∂r​k​​​​∂∑​i​​F(​ρ​¯​​​i​​)​​\nThe first term in the force formulation is non-zero only when kkk is either iii or jjj, thus it becomes\n−12[∂∑jj≠kVkj(rkj)∂rk+∂∑ik≠iVik(rik)∂rk]=−12[∂∑jj≠kVkj(rkj)∂rkj∂rkj∂rk−∂∑ik≠iVik(rik)∂rik∂rik∂rk]\n-\\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\frac{\\partial \\sum_{j \\atop j \\neq k} V_{kj}(r_{kj})}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k}+\\frac{\\partial \\sum_{i \\atop k \\neq i}V_{ik}(r_{ik})}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k}\\right] = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\frac{\\partial \\sum_{j \\atop j \\neq k} V_{kj}(r_{kj})}{\\partial r_{kj}}\\frac{\\partial r_{kj}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} - \\frac{\\partial \\sum_{i \\atop k \\neq i}V_{ik}(r_{ik})}{\\partial r_{ik}}\\frac{\\partial r_{ik}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k}\\right]\n−​2​​1​​[​∂r​k​​​​∂∑​​j≠k​j​​​​V​kj​​(r​kj​​)​​+​∂r​k​​​​∂∑​​k≠i​i​​​​V​ik​​(r​ik​​)​​]=−​2​​1​​[​∂r​kj​​​​∂∑​​j≠k​j​​​​V​kj​​(r​kj​​)​​​∂r​k​​​​∂r​kj​​​​−​∂r​ik​​​​∂∑​​k≠i​i​​​​V​ik​​(r​ik​​)​​​∂r​k​​​​∂r​ik​​​​]\nWith the help of the identity, the term becomes\n12[∂∑jj≠kVkj(rkj)∂rkjrkjrkj−∂∑ik≠iVik(rik)∂rikrikrik]\\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\frac{\\partial \\sum_{j \\atop j \\neq k} V_{kj}(r_{kj})}{\\partial r_{kj}}\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{kj}}{r_{kj}} - \\frac{\\partial \\sum_{i \\atop k \\neq i}V_{ik}(r_{ik})}{\\partial r_{ik}}\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{ik}}{r_{ik}}\\right]​2​​1​​[​∂r​kj​​​​∂∑​​j≠k​j​​​​V​kj​​(r​kj​​)​​​r​kj​​​​r​kj​​​​−​∂r​ik​​​​∂∑​​k≠i​i​​​​V​ik​​(r​ik​​)​​​r​ik​​​​r​ik​​​​]\nwhere VkjV_{kj}V​kj​​ and VikV_{ik}V​ik​​ are the pair potentials for the atomic pairs kjkjkj and ikikik, respectively, while Vkj=VjkV_{kj} = V_{jk}V​kj​​=V​jk​​ and Vik=VkiV_{ik} = V_{ki}V​ik​​=V​ki​​.
