A CAC simulation model, in general, partitions the simulation cell into two domains: a coarse-grained domain and an atomistic domain. Distinct from most concurrent multiscale methods in the literature, CAC employs a unified atomistic-continuum integral formulation with elements that have discontinuities between them; also, the underlying interatomic potential is the only constitutive relation in the system. As such, CAC admits propagation of displacement discontinuities (dislocations and associated intrinsic stacking faults) through a lattice in both atomistic and coarse-grained domains, as shown in the figure below.\nA 2-D CAC simulation domain consisting of an atomistic domain (right) and a coarse-grained domain (left) (Xu et al.). The atomistic domain is composed of atoms (black circles), which follow the same governing equations in the atomistic simulation. The coarse-grained domain consists of discontinuous elements of varying size, each of which contains a large number of underlying atoms with the nodes (red circles) as the only degrees of freedom. Only the force/energy on integration points (green circles) and nodes are calculated. The positions of atoms within each element (open circles) are interpolated from the nodal positions.

Some functions in MPI-3 standard are employed. It works with Open MPI version 2.1, Intel MPI version 5.1, MPICH version 3.3, and MVAPICH2 version 2.3.\nCompiler\nSome intrinsic functions in Fortran 2008 is employed in the code, so compilers that fully support Fortran 2008 are preferred. For example, GNU Fortran version 7.0 and Intel Fortran version 17.0 work with the PyCAC code.\nTo compile the code, simply run the install.sh file in the PyCAC code package, i.e.,\n./install.sh\nNote that the compilation process has not been tested on Microsoft Windows. On macOS, a message\n/opt/local/bin/ranlib: file: libcac.a(constant_para_module.o) has no symbols\nmay occur. The users are suggested to compile and run the PyCAC code on Linux, which dominates the high performance computing systems.\nModule\nIn compilation, the first step is to create a static library libcac.a from the 54 module files *_module.f90 in the module directory. There are five types of module files:\n*_comm_module.f90\nThere is only one *_comm_module.f90 file: precision_comm_module.f90. It controls the precision of the integer and real numbers.\n*_para_module.f90\nThere are 24 *_para_module.f90 files. They define single value variables that may be used globally.\n*_array_module.f90\nThere are 23 *_array_module.f90 files. They define arrays that may be used globally. With a few exceptions, the *_para_module.f90 and *_array_module.f90 files come in pairs.\n*_function_module.f90\nThere are 5 *_function_module.f90 files. They define interatomic potential formulations, arithmetic/linear algebra calculations, unit conversion, etc.\n*_tab_module.f90\nThere is only one *_tab_module.f90 file: eam_tab_module.f90. It contains algorithms that extract the EAM potential-based values from numerical tables.\nNote that these module files should be compiled in this order (see that the install.sh file) in creating the static library libcac.a. Otherwise, an error may occur.\nSubroutine\nThen, an executable, named CAC, is compiled using one main program (main.f90) plus 173 subroutines (*.f90) in the src directory and linked with the static library libcac.a.\nIn execution, the executable CAC, the input file cac.in, and the potential files are moved into the same directory. It follows that\nmpirun -np num_of_proc ./CAC where positive integer num_of_proc is the number of processors to be used. As an example, see the run.sh file in the PyCAC code package.\nThe users may run the PyCAC code on the MATerials Innovation Network (MATIN) at Georgia Tech when it is ready.\n"},"chapter1/publications.html":{"url":"chapter1/publications.html","title":"Publications","keywords":"","body":"Publications\nBook chapters\n\nShengfeng Yang, Youping Chen, Concurrent atomistic-continuum simulation of defects in polyatomic ionic materials, in Multiscale Materials Modeling for Nanomechanics (ed: Christopher R.

The formulation of the CAC balance equations, originally referred to as an atomic micromorphic theory or atomistic field theory (AFT) by Youping Chen and James D. Lee [1,3-8], is an extension of the Irving Kirkwood's formulation of \"the hydrodynamics equations for a single component, single phase system\" [9] to a two-level structural description of crystalline materials. The CAC formulation differs from that of classical continuum mechanics in that it employs a two-level structural description of materials. It is also distinct from the well-established theories of generalized continuum mechanics such as the Cosserat theory [10], micropolar theory [11,12], and micromorphic theory [13,14] in that the sub-level structural description is not continuous but discrete.\nThe first version of the CAC numerical tool was developed by Liming Xiong (Ph.D. 2011) and Qian Deng (Ph.D. 2011). The reformulated balance equations were numerically implemented using FE method with trilinear FE shape functions and nodal integration, and the simulation tool was demonstrated to be able to capture the phenomenon of phase transition in Si [15] and the dynamic processes of fracture, including crack initiation, propagation and branching (Fig. 1) [16,17].  \nFigure 1. Time sequence of CAC simulations of a brittle material (2.24 μm\\mu\\mathrm{m}μm by 1.4 μm\\mu\\mathrm{m}μm) showing (a) stress waves emitting from a propagating crack; (b) and (c) crack branching as a result of the interactions between waves propagating from the crack tip and those reflected from the specimen boundaries [17].\n\n\nThe form and capabilities of the CAC method were extended substantially as a direct result of collaborative efforts between University of Florida and Georgia Tech in modeling and simulations of the dynamics of dislocations: elements that have discontinuities between them were employed, and the Gaussian quadrature was used for integration in the coarse-grained domain. Nucleation and propagation of dislocations in the coarse-grained domain [18,19], passing dislocations from the atomistic domain to the coarse-grained domain [20], the growth of dislocation loops in Cu, Al and Si (Fig. 2(a)) [21], fast moving dislocations (Fig. 2(b)) [22], and other progresses [23-26], have been successfully simulated without special numerical treatment or supplemental constitutive relations. The name \"CAC\" for the methodology was coined by David L. McDowell in 2010.\nFigure 2. (a) CAC simulation results of the nucleation and growth of dislocation loops in Cu, Al, Si [21]. (b) Time sequences of dislocation motions in MD and fully coarse-grained CAC simulations [22].\n\n\nThe CAC code was rewritten using Fortran 90 by Shengfeng Yang (Ph.D. 2014) for multiscale simulation of polycrystalline ionic materials. This is the second-generation of the CAC code. It employs the Wolf method to calculate the long-range Columbic force and a special type of element (i.e., an incomplete element) to model regions with defects such as grain boundaries (GBs) in polyatomic materials. This version of the CAC code enables multiple meshing resolutions and simulation of two or more materials (e.g., Si and Ge), with multiple types of interatomic potentials, including the Buckingham and the Stillinger-Weber potentials. The CAC code was demonstrated to reproduce the equilibrium structures and energies of GBs in SrTiO3_3​3​​, in good agreement with those obtained from existing experiments and density functional theory calculations. The code has been used to study the dynamic processes of crack initiation as well as the evolution of dislocation in single crystalline [27], bicrytalline [28], and polycrystalline SrTiO3_3​3​​ (Fig. 3) [29,30].\nFigure 3. (a) A CAC model of polycrystalline SrTiO3_3​3​​ (2D view) in which the GBs are modeled with atomic resolution and the grains with coarse-scale finite elements; (b) Central symmetry parameter plot of the deformed model showing the nucleation and propagation of many dislocations and their interactions with the GBs; The comparison between (c) CAC and (d) MD simulation results is shown at strain 8.7% [30].\n\n\nThe CAC code was also rewritten by Shuozhi Xu (Ph.D. 2016) using Fortran 2008. The code was optimized and the efficiency was significantly improved. The code includes the quasistatic version of CAC to carry out quasistatic simulations so as to obtain energy minimized atomic and nodal structures, in addition to dynamic simulation. This version of code, termed PyCAC, has been well tested for ductile fracture [31], quasistatic dislocation migration [32], screw dislocation cross-slip [33], edge dislocations bowing out from obstacles [34], dislocation multiplication from Frank-Read sources [35], dislocation/stacking fault interactions [36], and dislocation/GB interactions (Fig. 4) [37,38].\nFigure 4. Snapshots of dislocation pile-up with dominant leading screw character impinging against a Σ3\\Sigma 3Σ3{111} coherent twin boundary (CTB) [38]. In (a), five incoming dislocations approach the CTB subject to an applied shear stress. In (b), the leading dislocation is constricted at the CTB, where two Shockley partial dislocations are recombined into a full dislocation. In (c), with certain interatomic potentials, the dislocation effectively cross-slips into the outgoing twinned grain via redissociation into two partials. In (d), with different potentials, the redissociated dislocation is absorbed by the CTB, with two partials gliding on the twin plane in opposite directions.\n\n\nBased on the Fortran 90 code, Xiang Chen (Ph.D. 2016) extended the CAC method for space- and time-resolved simulation of the transient processes of the propagation of heat pulses in single crystals and across GBs [39] as well as the interactions between heat pulses and moving dislocations (Fig. 5) [40]. A phonon representation of the heat pulses, termed a coherent phonon pulse model [41], was created to mimic the coherent lattice excitation achieved via ultrashort laser pulses, and was incorporated into the framework of CAC to provide a coupled treatment for defect dynamics and phonon thermal transport. A first attempt was made to pass full phonon spectrum from the atomistic domain to the coarse-grained domain by introducing a wave-based interpolation scheme [42].\nFigure 5. Normalized kinetic energy distribution in simulations of the propagation of dislocations and a heat pulse: (a-c) a moving dislocation before meeting a heat pulse, showing that the motion of the dislocation is accompanied by radial-shaped wavefronts of phonons ahead of the moving dislocation and V-shaped wave tails in the wake of the dislocation; (d) the dislocation meeting with a propagating heat pulse; (e-f) an array of moving dislocations meeting with the heat pulse showing partially coherent partially diffuse scattering of the phonons by the moving dislocations [40].\n\n\nThe groups of Profs. McDowell, Chen, and Xiong are still actively advancing the CAC method. Keep an eye on the CAC publications for the latest progress!\nReferences\n\nYouping Chen, James Lee.

The coarse-grained and atomistic domains are deformed only if boolean_cg and boolean_at are t, respectively.\ndef_num sets the number of superimposed deformation modes.\nij decides each deformation mode, i.e., how the strain is applied. Following the standard indexes ϵij\\epsilon_{ij}ϵ​ij​​ in continuum mechanics, i and j are the face on which and the direction along which the strain is applied. When i and j are the same, a uniaxial strain is applied; otherwise, a shear strain is applied.\ndef_rate is the strain rate, in ps−1^{-1}​−1​​.\nstress_l and stress_u are the lower and upper bounds of the stress tensor component (designated by ij) of the simulation cell, respectively, in GPa. In CAC simulations, all stress components are usually small at the beginning. Subject to the strain, most stress tensor components increase in magnitude until one of them is higher than the corresponding stress_u, at which point the strain rate tensor changes sign, i.e., the deformation is reversed but each ij remains unchanged. Subject to the newly reversed strain, most stress tensor components decrease until one of them is lower than the corresponding stress_l, in which case the strain rate tensor changes sign again, i.e., the deformation is applied as the initial setting. Whether the stress component is out of bounds is monitored not at every step, but at every flip_frequency step.\nThe deformation begins when the simulation step equals time_start and stops when it exceeds time_end.\nWhen (i) the simulation step is larger than time_always_flip and (ii) the simulation step does not exceed time_end and (iii) the strain rate tensor did not change sign previously, the strain rate tensor changes sign at every step, regardless of the stress bounds defined by stress_l and stress_u. This is used, e.g., to keep a quasi-constant strain while the nodes and atoms adjust their positions in dynamic or quasistatic equilibrium. To disable this option, the user may set time_always_flip to be larger than time_end.\nRelated commands\nGroups defined by the bd_group and group commands may be homogeneously deformed along with the simulation cell, depending on the value of boolean_def in these two commands.\nRelated files\ndeform_init.f90 and deform_box.f90\nDefault\ndeform f 1 xx f f 0. 0. 0. 1 time 0 0 0\n"},"chapter5/dump.html":{"url":"chapter5/dump.html","title":"dump","keywords":"","body":"dump\nSyntax\ndump output_freq reduce_freq restart_freq log_freq\n\noutput_freq, reduce_freq, restart_freq, log_freq = positive integer\n\nExamples\ndump 500 300 1000 10\nDescription\nThis command sets the frequency with which the output is performed.

The elements/nodes/atoms in a group are displaced at each simulation step (when boolean_move = t), deformed with the simulation cell (when boolean_def = t), or not displaced/deformed. In any case, when the simulation step is between time_start and time_end, the equivalent nodal/atomic force of the group calculated by the interatomic potential is discarded in constraint.f90 and so does not take any effect. The syntax, to some extent, is similar to the first of that of the modify command, except that there is no controlled displacement information in the latter.\nThe new groups are created by first providing the elements/nodes/atoms information (by options from style_cg to group_radius_small) while the same information for the restart groups is read from group_in_#.id, where # is a positive integer starting from new_group_number + 1. A group_in_#.id file can be renamed from a group_out_#.id file that was created automatically in previous CAC simulations of which the total number of groups > 0.\nFor the restart groups, which are introduced when boolean_restart_group = t and restart_group_number > 0, the syntax of this command becomes (e.g., the fifth example)\ngroup group_name boolean_move boolean_release boolean_def\n      vel vel_x vel_y vel_z\n      time time_start time_end\n      disp disp_lim\n      boolean_grad boolean_switch\n      grad_ref_axis grad_vel_axis\n      grad_ref_l grad_ref_u\nstyle_cg decides whether the group contains elements (element), nodes (node), or nothing (null) in the coarse-grained domain. The differences between element and node are also important in the bd_group command. style_at decides whether the group contains atoms (atom) or nothing (null) in the atomistic domain.\nThere are currently five group_shape: block, cylinder, cone, tube, and sphere. For the boundary groups, group_shape = block.\nlower_b and upper_b are the lower and upper boundaries of the group_shape, respectively, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the corresponding direction. When lower_b or upper_b = inf, the corresponding lower or upper simulation cell boundaries are taken as the group_shape boundaries, respectively. Note that when group_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, lower_b and upper_b are the lower and upper plane boundaries normal to the central axis group_axis direction, respectively.\ni, j, and k decide the group_shape (≠\\neq≠ sphere) boundary plane orientations with respect to the simulation cell, similar to those in the box_dir command.\nNote that these five options (lower_b, upper_b, i, j, and k) are irrelevant when group_shape = sphere, and when group_shape = cylinder or cone or tube if the corresponding direction is not group_axis. Also, group_axis is irrelevant when group_shape = block or sphere. However, they need to be provided regardless.\nWhen boolean_in = t, elements/nodes/atoms inside the group_shape belong to the group; otherwise, those outside do.\ngroup_centroid_x, group_centroid_y, and group_centroid_z, in units of the maximum lattice periodicity length lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​, are the coordinates of the center of the base plane of a cylinder or cone or tube, or the center of a sphere. When group_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, the group_centroid_* that corresponds to the group_axis direction becomes irrelevant. For example, when group_axis = 2, group_centroid_y can take any real number without affecting the results.\ngroup_radius_large is the base radius of a cylinder, the large base radius of a cone, the outer base radius of a tube, or the radius of a sphere. group_radius_small, the small base radius of a cone or the inner base radius of a tube, is irrelevant for other group_shape. Both group_radius_large and group_radius_small are in units of the maximum lattice periodicity length lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​.\nNote that these six options (group_axis, group_centroid_*, and group_radius_*) are not relevant when group_shape = block. Yet, they need to be provided regardless.\nWhen boolean_move = t, the group is assigned a displacement at each simulation step; otherwise, no controlled displacement is applied and all following options become irrelevant, as in the first example. In this case, the purpose of having a group is to calculate certain mechanical quantities of this group such as energy, force, and stress.\nThe group is assigned a controlled displacement when the simulation step > time_start. Then when the simulation step > time_end, the group is no longer assigned a controlled displacement when boolean_release = t; otherwise, the group is assigned a zero velocity vector at each simulation step, i.e., fixed.\nWhen boolean_def = t, the group is deformed along with the simulation box, the same as that in the bd_group command. Note that in both commands, the group is deformed only when the simulation step is between time_start and time_end. This option takes effect regardless of the velocity vector. \n[vel_x, vel_y, vel_z] is the velocity vector assigned to the group at each simulation step, in Angstrom/ps.\ndisp_lim is the upper bound of the magnitude of the total group displacement, in units of the lattice constant. For example, if a group is displaced first by vector a\\mathbf{a}a then by vector b\\mathbf{b}b that is not parallel to a\\mathbf{a}a, the total displacement is defined as ∣a∣+∣b∣|\\mathbf{a}| + |\\mathbf{b}|∣a∣+∣b∣, instead of ∣a+b∣|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}|∣a+b∣. If the total displacement magnitude is larger than disp_lim, the velocity vector is zeroed.\nWhen boolean_grad = t, the displacement is assigned to the group gradiently, i.e., different elements/nodes/atoms in the group may have a different [vel_x, vel_y, vel_z] vector. The grad_vel_axis component of the velocity vector is linearly applied to the group based on the positions of elements/nodes/atoms along the grad_ref_axis direction. grad_ref_l and grad_ref_u are the lower and upper bounds of the graded displacement, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the grad_ref_axis direction, with inf referring to the relevant simulation cell boundaries. The elements/nodes/atoms located at or below grad_ref_l are assigned a zero velocity vector, i.e., fixed; those located at or above grad_ref_u are assigned [vel_x, vel_y, vel_z]; those located between grad_ref_l and grad_ref_u are assigned a vector whose grad_vel_axis component is linearly graded while the other two components remain the same with respect to [vel_x, vel_y, vel_z].\nIn the third example, the elements/nodes/atoms which are located below 50.0⋅l′⃗0[2]50.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[2]50.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[2] along the y axis (because grad_ref_axis = 2) are assigned a zero velocity vector; those located above 60.0⋅l′⃗0[2]60.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[2]60.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[2] along the y axis are assigned [vel_x, vel_y, vel_z]; those in between are assigned a linearly graded velocity vector whose x component (because grad_vel_axis = 1) is varied between zero and vel_x while its y and z components are vel_y and vel_z, respectively.\nWhen boolean_switch = t, the lower and upper bounds of the graded displacement are switched. In the fourth example, the elements/nodes/atoms which are located below 10.0⋅l′⃗0[3]10.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[3]10.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[3] along the z axis (because grad_ref_axis = 3) are assigned [vel_x, vel_y, vel_z]; those located above 100.0⋅l′⃗0[3]100.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[3]100.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[3] along the z axis are assigned a zero velocity vector; those in between are assigned a linearly graded velocity vector whose y component (because grad_vel_axis = 2) is varied between zero and vel_y while its x and z components are vel_x and vel_z, respectively.\nRelated commands\nThere cannot be fewer group commands than new_group_number + restart_group_number.

Once the direction is set, the inner iterations begin in which a line search is conducted to determine the length by which the nodes/atoms need to move along the designated direction to find the minimized energy. For more information of the energy minimization with these two styles, read chapter 3 of Shuozhi Xu's Ph.D. dissertation.\nThe fire style is based on Bitzek et al., 2006 while the qm style is based on quenched dynamics which is used also in dynamic CAC. The difference is that only one quenched dynamics iteration is carried out at each simulation step in dynamic CAC while many quenched dynamics iterations are performed at each simulation step during the energy minimization until the internal energy converges at that step. For the fire and qm styles, the inner iteration is irrelevant.\nThe energy minimization is considered to converge when either the number of outer iterations reaches max_iteraction or the energy variation between successive outer iterations divided by the energy of the current iteration is less than tolerance.\nRelated commands\nThis command is relevant only when simulation_style = statics or hybrid.\nRelated files\nquasi_statics.f90, mini_init.f90, update_mini.f90, mini_energy.f90, hybrid.f90, conjugate_gradient.f90, steepest_descent.f90, quick_mini.f90, and fire.f90\nDefault\nminimize cg 1000 1d-6\n"},"chapter5/modify_num.html":{"url":"chapter5/modify_num.html","title":"modify_num","keywords":"","body":"modify_num\nSyntax\nmodify_num modify_number\n\nmodify_number = non-negative integer (\n\nExamples\nmodify_num 2\nDescription\nThis command sets the number of modifications that are made to the elements/nodes/atoms that are built from scratch, i.e., when boolean_restart = f.\nRelated commands\nThe modification style is set by the modify command.\nThis command becomes irrelevant when boolean_restart = t, in which case there is no need for the modification information.\nRelated files\nmodel_modify.f90\nDefault\nmodify_num 0\n"},"chapter5/modify.html":{"url":"chapter5/modify.html","title":"modify","keywords":"","body":"modify\nSyntax\nmodify modify_name modify_style modify_shape\n       x lower_b upper_b i j k\n       y lower_b upper_b i j k\n       z lower_b upper_b i j k\n       boolean_in boolean_delete_filled modify_axis\n       modify_centroid_x modify_centroid_y modify_centroid_z\n       modify_radius_large modify_radius_small\n\nmodify modify_name modify_style depth tolerance\n\nmodify_name = a string (length \n\nmodify_style = delete or cg2at or cutoff\n\nmodify_shape = block or cylinder or cone or tube or sphere\n\nlower_b, upper_b = real number or inf\n\ni, j, k = real number\n\nboolean_in, boolean_delete_filled = t or f\n  t is true\n  f is false\n\nmodify_axis = 1 or 2 or 3\n\nmodify_centroid_x, modify_centroid_y, modify_centroid_z = real number\n\nmodify_radius_large, modify_radius_small, depth, tolerance = positive real number\n\n\nExamples\nmodify modify_1 delete cylinder x 0. 1. 0.94281 0. -0.33333 y inf inf 0. 1. 0. z inf inf 0. 0. 1. t t 3 50. 50. 1. 2. 5.\nmodify modify_2 cg2at block x inf inf 1. 0. 0. y 1. 12. 0. 0.94281 -0.33333 z inf inf 0. 0. 1. t f 1 20. 4. 5. 17. 13.\nmodify modify_3 cutoff 0.1 0.01\nDescription\nThis command sets the modifications made to the elements/nodes/atoms that are built from scratch, i.e., when boolean_restart = f. The first syntax, to some extent, is similar to that of the group command for the new group, except that there is no controlled displacement information in the former.\nThere are currently three modify_style: delete, cg2at, and cutoff. When modify_style = delete or cg2at, the first syntax is used; otherwise, the second syntax with depth and tolerance is used.\nIn the first syntax, there are five modify_shape: block, cylinder, cone, tube, and sphere. With respect to the simulation cell built from scratch, delete removes some elements/atoms and cg2at refines some elements into atomic scale.\nlower_b and upper_b are the lower and upper boundaries of the modify_shape, respectively, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the corresponding direction. When lower_b or upper_b = inf, the corresponding lower or upper simulation cell boundaries are taken as the modify_shape boundaries, respectively. Note that when modify_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, lower_b and upper_b are the lower and upper plane boundaries normal to the central axis group_axis direction, respectively.\ni, j, and k decide the modify_shape (≠\\neq≠ sphere) boundary plane orientations with respect to the simulation cell, similar to those in the box_dir command.\nNote that these five options (lower_b, upper_b, i, j, and k) are irrelevant when modify_shape = sphere, and when modify_shape = cylinder or cone or tube if the corresponding direction is not modify_axis. Also, modify_axis is irrelevant when modify_shape = block or sphere. However, they need to be provided regardless.\nWhen boolean_in = t, elements with any of their parts (in the coarse-grained domain) and atoms (in the atomistic domain) inside the modify_shape are deleted (delete) or refined to atomic scale (cg2at); otherwise, those outside are. In the coarse-grained domain, an element might have some part  of it inside and the remaining part outside modify_shape; for this element, with delete, the region that is left behind due to the deletion may not have the shape specified by modify_shape. In this case, if boolean_delete_filled = t, atoms (that are linearly interpolated from the original element) will be filled in to maintain the modify_shape. E.g., if boolean_in = t, the interpolated atoms of the deleted elements that are outside modify_shape are filled in; otherwise, those inside are, as shown in the figure below. Note that boolean_delete_filled is irrelevant when modify_style = cg2at.\n\nAlso note that while delete applies to both atomistic and coarse-grained domains, cg2at applied to the coarse-grained domain only. Different from the group command in which the user should pay attention to the difference between element and node, a modification follows one simple rule in the coarse-grained domain: an element and all its nodes are selected if any interpolated atom of this element is inside (if boolean_in = t) or outside (if boolean_in = f) modify_shape.\nmodify_centroid_x, modify_centroid_y, and modify_centroid_z, in units of the maximum lattice periodicity length lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​, are the coordinates of the center of the base plane of a cylinder or cone or tube, or the center of a sphere. When modify_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, the modify_centroid_* that corresponds to the modify_axis becomes irrelevant. For example, when modify_axis = 3, modify_centroid_z can take any real number without affecting the results.\nmodify_radius_large is the base radius of a cylinder, the large base radius of a cone, the outer base radius of a tube, or the radius of a sphere. modify_radius_small, the small base radius of a cone or the inner base radius of a tube, is irrelevant for other modify_shape. Both modify_radius_large and modify_radius_small are in units of the maximum lattice periodicity length lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​.\nNote that these six options (modify_axis, modify_centroid_*, and modify_radius_*) are not relevant when modify_shape = block. Yet, they need to be provided regardless.\nIn the second syntax, which is for modify_style = cutoff, depth and tolerance, in units of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the grain stack direction, specify the size of the target region and the cutoff distance, respectively, as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe cutoff style is used to delete one atom from a pair of atoms (either real atoms in the atomistic domain or interpolated atoms in the coarse-grained domain) when their distance tolerance, at the grain boundary. The situation that some atoms are too close to each other is usually because of the overlap or grain origin displacements. Naturally, tolerance cannot be larger than or equal to the first nearest neighbor distance in a perfect lattice.\nAt each grain boundary, a check is first conducted, within the region set by depth along the grain stack direction, on both the real atoms in the atomistic domain or the interpolated atoms in the coarse-grained doain. In the figure above, (i) all atoms in the red shaded region (grain I) will be run against those in the left green shaded region (grain II), (ii) all atoms in the right green shaded region (grain II) will be run against those in the blue shaded region (grain III). Within a pair, if both are real atoms, the one associated with a smaller grain_id is deleted; if one is a real atom and the other is an interpolated atom, the real atom is deleted; if both are interpolated atoms, the user will get an error message because it is impossible to delete a single interpolated atom from an element, which would violate the hyperelastic body assumption of an element.\nRelated commands\nThere cannot be fewer modify commands than modify_number. When there are too many modify commands in cac.in, those appearing later will be ignored.\nThis command becomes irrelevant when boolean_restart = t or modify_number = 0, in which case there is no need for the modification information.\nRelated files\nmodel_modify.f90, model_modify_interpo.f90, model_cutoff.f90, model_cutoff_bd.f90, and model_rearrange.f90.\nDefault\nNone.\n"},"chapter5/neighbor.html":{"url":"chapter5/neighbor.html","title":"neighbor","keywords":"","body":"neighbor\nSyntax\nneighbor bin_size neighbor_freq\n\nbin_size = non-negative real number\n\nneighbor_freq = positive integer\n\n\nExamples\nneighbor 1. 100\nneighbor 2. 200\nDescription\nThis command sets parameters for updating the neighbor list.

The outer loop, illustrated by {}, is based on grain; the inner loop, illustrated by [], is based on subdomain. Note that the curly brackets { and } as well as the square brackets [ and ] in the syntax/examples are to separate different grains and subdomains, the number of which are grain_number and subdomain_number, respectively; all brackets should not be included in preparing cac.in.\nThe number of atoms per unit is (unitype+1)3(\\mathrm{unitype}+1)^3(unitype+1)​3​​, where unitype must be either 1 (atomistic domain) or an even integer that is no less than 4 (coarse-grained domain): in the latter case, (i) it must be even because of the first order Gaussian quadrature employed to solve the governing equations, (ii) it must be >= 4 because of the second nearest neighbor (2NN) element with 125 integration points (so there cannot be fewer than 125 atoms in one element). For more information of the 2NN element and the Gaussian quadrature implementation, read Appendices A and B of Xu et al., 2015.\nThe three examples above correspond to the three examples in the subdomain command:\n\nIn the first example, there is only one grain, designated by the first 1, having only one subdomain, designated by the second 1, with the unitype = 12.\nIn the second example, there are two grains, designated by the first 1 and the second 2, respectively. The first grain has two subdomains: the first is atomistics because unitype = 1; the second contains elements each of which has (8+1)3=729(8+1)^3 = 729(8+1)​3​​=729 atoms. The second grain has three subdomains: the first contains elements each of which has (6+1)3=343(6+1)^3 = 343(6+1)​3​​=343 atoms; the second contains elements each of which has (16+1)3=4913(16+1)^3 = 4913(16+1)​3​​=4913 atoms; the third contains elements each of which has (10+1)3=1331(10+1)^3 = 1331(10+1)​3​​=1331 atoms.\nIn the third example, there are three grains, each of which contains one unit type.

On the other hand, flat boundaries are sometimes desirable to enforce the periodic boundary conditions or to lower the aphysical stress concentrations at the boundaries.\nIf one of the three booleans in this command is f, atoms will be filled in the corresponding jagged interstices, resulting in flat boundaries normal to the corresponding direction, unless the boundaries were already flat with rhomboheral elements, e.g., parallel to a {111} plane in an FCC lattice or to a {110} plane in a BCC lattice. Examples of the filled atoms include Fig. C27(b) of Xu et al., 2015 and the figure for the subdomain command in which the atoms are filled in at the leftmost and rightmost simulation cell boundaries.

For example, the lattice constant a0a_0a​0​​ in cubic crystal systems is the lattice periodicity length along the 100>\\left⟨100⟩ directions.\nOnce the crystallographic orientations are set, e.g., the xxx axis in the first grain has an orientation of [abc][abc][abc], the lattice will repeat itself at every a2+b2+c2a0\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}a_0√​a​2​​+b​2​​+c​2​​​​​a​0​​ distant along the xxx direction. However, this distant may not be the smallest lattice periodicity length. For example, when [abc]=[112][abc] = [112][abc]=[112], a2+b2+c2a0=6a0\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}a_0 = \\sqrt{6}a_0√​a​2​​+b​2​​+c​2​​​​​a​0​​=√​6​​​a​0​​, yet the smallest lattice periodicity length l0=(6/2)a0l_0 = (\\sqrt{6}/2)a_0l​0​​=(√​6​​​/2)a​0​​.\nSo how is l0l_0l​0​​ calculated for any given [abc][abc][abc]? First, one calculates l=a2+b2+c2l = a^2 + b^2 + c^2l=a​2​​+b​2​​+c​2​​. Second, one divides lll by 2, then by 2 again, and so on, until the result is not divisable by 2. For example, if l=24l = 24l=24, one gets 24/2=1224/2 = 1224/2=12, then 12/2=612/2 = 612/2=6, then 6/2=36/2 = 36/2=3, then 333 is not divisible by 2. During this process, lll and its quotients are divided by 2 for 3 times, then one get an integer Δ=3\\Delta = 3Δ=3. Finally, l0=(l/Δ)a0l_0 = (\\sqrt{l}/\\Delta)a_0l​0​​=(√​l​​​/Δ)a​0​​.
