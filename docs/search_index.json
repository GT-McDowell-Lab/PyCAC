The IDs of these groups are after the regular groups created by the group command. The groups created using this command are rigid, i.e., the elements/nodes/atoms are not displaced subject to the interatomic forces, expect (possibly) following the overall deformation of the simulation cell.\nboolean_l and boolean_u decide whether the lower and upper boundaries along each axis are involved, respectively. If any of these two boolean is true, style_cg and style_at decide whether the group contains elements, nodes, atoms, or null, see here for the differences between element and node.\nAll groups defined by the bd_group command have a block shape. Along the y axis, for example, the two block-shape groups are bounded by\nx inf inf y inf depth z inf inf\nx inf inf y upper_b-depth inf z inf inf\nwhere upper_b is the upper bound of the simulation cell, similar to that in the group command. Note that the depth must be a real number, e.g., 2., instead of an integer, e.g., 2. The depth is in unit of the lattice_space_max along respective axis.\nboolean_def decides whether the group is deformed along with the simulation cell, similar to the one in the group command.\ntime_start and time_end, in the unit of time step, are two integers of when the groups begin and stop being rigid.\nRelated commands\nThis command provides a shortcut to create groups, which can be done by the group command.\nRelated files\ngroup_init.f90\nDefault\nNone.\n"},"chapter5/boundary.html":{"url":"chapter5/boundary.html","title":"boundary","keywords":"","body":"boundary\nSyntax\nboundary bc_x bc_y bc_z\n\nbc_x, bc_y, bc_z = p or s or f\n  p is periodic\n  f is non-periodic and fixed\n  s is non-periodic and shrink-wrapped\n\n\nExamples\nboundary p f s\nDescription\nSet the style of boundaries for the global simulation box in each dimension.

The deformation is underway if boolean_def is t.\ndef_num defines how many deformation matrix is added. When def_num > 1, all deformation matrices are linearly superimposed.\nij decides how the strain is applied. Following the standard indexes in continuum mechanics, i and j are the face on which and the direction along which the strain is applied. When i and j are the same, a uniaxial strain is set, otherwise, a shear strain is set.\ndef_rate is the strain rate, in the unit of ps$$^{-1}$$.\nstress_l and stress_u are the lower and upper bounds of the applied stress, respectively, for the stress tensor component specified by ij, in unit of GPa. Assume that all stress components are initially zero or very small. Then when the stress component is higher than stress_u, the corresponding strain rate changes sign, i.e., the deformation is reversed. Afterward, when the stress component is lower than stress_l, the corresponding strain rate changes sign again, i.e., the deformation proceeds as the initial setting. Whether the stress component is out of the bounds is checked not every step, but at every flip_frequency step.\nThe deformation begins after time step time_start and ends after time_end. When the time step is larger than time_always_flip but smaller than time_end, the strain rate changes sign at every step back and forth, regardless of the stress bounds defined by stress_l and stress_u.\nRelated commands\nGroups defined by the group and bd_group commands may be homogeneous deformed along with the simulation cell, depending on settings in those two commands.\nRelated files\ndeform_init.f90 and deform_box.f90\nDefault\nboolean_def = f.\n"},"chapter5/dump.html":{"url":"chapter5/dump.html","title":"dump","keywords":"","body":"dump\nSyntax\nboundary x y z\n\nx,y,z = p or s or f\n  p is periodic\n  f is non-periodic and fixed\n  s is non-periodic and shrink-wrapped\n\n\nExamples\nboundary p f s\nDescription\nSet the style of boundaries for the global simulation box in each dimension.
