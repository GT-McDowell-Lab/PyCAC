A CAC simulation model, in general, partitions the simulation cell into two domains: a coarse-grained domain and an atomistic domain. Distinct from most concurrent multiscale methods in the literature, CAC employs a unified atomistic-continuum integral formulation with elements that have discontinuities between them; also, the underlying interatomic potential is the only constitutive relation in the system. As such, CAC admits propagation of displacement discontinuities (dislocations and associated intrinsic stacking faults) through a lattice in both atomistic and coarse-grained domains.\nIn a (big) nutshell, CAC\n\ndescribes certain lattice defects and their interactions using fully resolved atomistics;\npreserves the net Burgers vector and associated long range stress fields of curved, mixed character dislocations in a sufficiently large continuum domain in a fully 3D model;\nemploys the same governing equations and interatomic potentials in both domains to avoid the usage of phenomenological parameters, essential remeshing operations and ad hoc procedures for passing dislocation segments between atomistic and coarse-grained atomistic domains.\n\n"},"chapter1/pycac-feature.html":{"url":"chapter1/pycac-feature.html","title":"PyCAC features and non-features","keywords":"","body":"PyCAC features and non-features\nFeatures\nThe PyCAC code can simulate pure face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC) metals using the Lennard-Jones (LJ) or the embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials.

Some functions in MPI-3 standard is provided. It works with Open MPI version 2.1, Intel MPI version 5.1, MPICH version 3.3, and MVAPICH2 version 2.3.\nCompiler\nSome intrinsic functions in Fortran 2008 is employed in the code, so compilers that fully support Fortran 2008 are preferred. For example, GNU Fortran version 7.0 and Intel Fortran version 17.0 work with the PyCAC code.\nModule\nIn compilation, the first step is to create a static library libcac.a from the 54 module files *_module.f90 in the module directory. There are five types of module files:\n*_comm_module.f90\nThere is only one *_comm_module.f90 file: precision_comm_module.f90. It controls the precision of the integer and real numbers.\n*_para_module.f90\nThere are 24 *_para_module.f90 files. They define single value variables that may be used globally.\n*_array_module.f90\nThere are 23 *_array_module.f90 files. They define arrays that may be used globally. With a few exceptions, the *_para_module.f90 and *_array_module.f90 files come in pairs.\n*_function_module.f90\nThere are 5 *_function_module.f90 files. They define interatomic potential formulations, arithmetic/linear algebra calculations, unit conversion, etc.\n*_tab_module.f90\nThere is only one *_tab_module.f90 file: eam_tab_module.f90. It contains algorithms that extract the EAM potential-based values from numerical tables.\nNote that these module files should be compiled in this order (see that the install.sh file) in creating the static library libcac.a. Otherwise, an error may occur.\nSubroutine\nThen, an executable, named CAC, is compiled using one main program (main.f90) plus 171 subroutines (*.f90) in the src directory and linked with the static library libcac.a.\nIn execution, the executable CAC, the input file cac.in, and the potential files are moved into the same directory. It follows that\nmpirun -np num_of_proc ./CAC where positive integer num_of_proc is the number of processors to be used.\nThe users may run the PyCAC code on the MATerials Innovation Network (MATIN) at Georgia Tech when it is ready.\n"},"chapter1/cac-publications.html":{"url":"chapter1/cac-publications.html","title":"CAC Publications","keywords":"","body":"CAC Publications\nBook chapters\n\nShengfeng Yang, Youping Chen, Concurrent atomistic-continuum simulation of defects in polyatomic ionic materials, in Multiscale Materials Modeling for Nanomechanics (ed: Christopher R.

The coarse-grained and atomistic domains are deformed only if boolean_cg and boolean_at are t, respectively.\ndef_num sets the number of superimposed deformation modes.\nij decides each deformation mode, i.e., how the strain is applied. Following the standard indexes ϵij\\epsilon_{ij}ϵ​ij​​ in continuum mechanics, i and j are the face on which and the direction along which the strain is applied. When i and j are the same, a uniaxial strain is applied; otherwise, a shear strain is applied.\ndef_rate is the strain rate, in unit of ps−1^{-1}​−1​​.\nstress_l and stress_u are the lower and upper bounds of the stress tensor component (designated by ij) of the simulation cell, respectively, in unit of GPa. In CAC simulations, all stress components are usually small at the beginning. Subject to the strain, most stress tensor components increase in magnitude until one of them is higher than the corresponding stress_u, at which point the strain rate tensor changes sign, i.e., the deformation is reversed but each ij remains unchanged. Subject to the newly reversed strain, most stress tensor components decrease until one of them is lower than the corresponding stress_l, in which case the strain rate tensor changes sign again, i.e., the deformation is applied as the initial setting. Whether the stress component is out of bounds is monitored not at every step, but at every flip_frequency step.\nThe deformation begins when the simulation step equals time_start and stops when it exceeds time_end.\nWhen (i) the simulation step is larger than time_always_flip and (ii) the simulation step does not exceed time_end and (iii) the strain rate tensor did not change sign previously, the strain rate tensor changes sign at every step, regardless of the stress bounds defined by stress_l and stress_u. This is used, e.g., to keep a quasi-constant strain while the nodes and atoms adjust their positions in dynamic or quasistatic equilibrium. To disable this option, the user may set time_always_flip to be larger than time_end.\nRelated commands\nGroups defined by the bd_group and group commands may be homogeneously deformed along with the simulation cell, depending on the value of boolean_def in these two commands.\nRelated files\ndeform_init.f90 and deform_box.f90\nDefault\ndeform f 1 xx f f 0. 0. 0. 1 time 0 0 0\n"},"chapter5/dump.html":{"url":"chapter5/dump.html","title":"dump","keywords":"","body":"dump\nSyntax\ndump output_freq reduce_freq restart_freq log_freq\n\noutput_freq, reduce_freq, restart_freq, log_freq = positive integer\n\nExamples\ndump 500 300 1000 10\nDescription\nThis command sets the frequency with which the output is performed.

The elements/nodes/atoms in a group are displaced at each simulation step (when boolean_move = t), deformed with the simulation cell deformation (when boolean_def = t), or not displaced/deformed. In any case, when the total_step is between time_start and time_end, the force on the group calculated by the interatomic potential is discarded in constraint.f90 and so does not take effect. The syntax, to some extent, is similar to the first one of the modify command.\nThe new groups are created by first providing the elements/nodes/atoms information (by options from style_cg to group_radius_small) while the same information for the restart groups is read from group_in_#.id, where # is an positive integer starting from new_group_number + 1. The group_in_#.id files are renamed from the group_out_#.id files that were created automatically in previous CAC simulations when the total number of groups > 0.\nFor the restart groups, which are introduced when boolean_restart_group = t and restart_group_number > 0, the syntax of this command becomes (e.g., the fifth example)\ngroup group_name boolean_move boolean_release boolean_def\n      vel vel_x vel_y vel_z\n      time time_start time_end\n      disp disp_lim\n      boolean_grad boolean_switch\n      grad_ref_axis grad_vel_axis\n      grad_ref_l grad_ref_u\nstyle_cg decides whether the group contains elements (element), nodes (node), or nothing (null) in the coarse-grained domain. The differences between element and node are also important in the bd_group command. style_at decides whether the group contains atoms (atom) or nothing (null) in the atomistic domain.\nThere are currently five group_shape: block, cylinder, cone, tube, and sphere. The groups introduced in the bd_group command has group_shape = block.\nlower_b and upper_b are the lower and upper boundariess of the group_shape, respectively, in unit of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​, for the corresponding direction. When lower_b or upper_b is inf, the corresponding lower or upper simulation cell boundaries are taken as the group_shape boundaries, respectively.\nlower_b and upper_b are their plane boundaries normal to the central axis group_axis direction. Note that group_axis is irrelevant when group_shape = sphere.\ni, j, and k decide the group_shape (= block) boundary plane orientations with respect to the simulation cell, similar to those in the box_dir command. When modify_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, they decide the direction of the group_axis, similar to those in the modify commands.\nNote that these five options (lower_b, upper_b, i, j, and k) are irrelevant when group_shape = sphere, and when group_shape = cylinder or cone or tube if the corresponding direction is not group_axis. However, they need to be provided regardless.\nWhen boolean_in = t, elements/nodes/atoms inside the group_shape belong to the group; otherwise, those outside do.\ngroup_centroid_x, group_centroid_y, and group_centroid_z, in unit of the maximum lattice periodicity length lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​, are the coordinates of the center of the base plane of a cylinder or cone or tube, or the center of a sphere. When group_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, the group_centroid_* that corresponds to the group_axis becomes irrelevant. For example, when group_axis = 2, group_centroid_y can take any real number without affecting the results.\ngroup_radius_large is the base radius of a cylinder, the large base radius of a cone, the outer base radius of a tube, or the radius of a sphere. group_radius_small, the small base radius of a cone or the inner base radius of a tube, is irrelevant for other group_shape. Both group_radius_large and group_radius_small are in unit of the maximum lattice periodicity length lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​.\nNote that these six options (group_axis, group_centroid_*, and group_radius_*) are not relevant when group_shape = block. Yet, they need to be provided regardless.\nWhen boolean_move = t, the group is assigned a displacement at each simulation step; otherwise, no controlled displacement is applied and all following options become irrelevant, as in the first example. In the latter case, the purpose of having a group is to calculate certain mechanical quantities of this group such as energy, force, and stress.\nWhen boolean_release = t, the group is no longer assigned a displacement at each simulation step when total_step > time_end; otherwise, the group is assigned a zero displacment vector, i.e., fixed, when total_step > time_end.\nWhen boolean_def = t, the group is deformed along with the simulation box, the same as that in the bd_group command. Note that in both commands, the group is deformed only when total_step is between time_start and time_end. This option takes effect regardless of the controlled displacement vector. \n[vel_x, vel_y, vel_z] is the displacement vector assigned to the group at each simulation step, in unit of ps/Angstrom.\ntime_start and time_end are the starting and ending simulation steps, respectively, for the controlled displacement.\ndisp_lim is the upper bounds of the magnitude of the total group displacement, in unit of the lattice constant. For example, if a group is displaced first by vector a\\mathbf{a}a then by vector b\\mathbf{b}b that is not parallel to a\\mathbf{a}a, the total displacement is defined as ∣a∣+∣b∣|\\mathbf{a}| + |\\mathbf{b}|∣a∣+∣b∣, instead of ∣a+b∣|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}|∣a+b∣. If the total displacement is larger than disp_lim, the displacement vector is zeroed.\nWhen boolean_grad = t, the displacement is assigned to the group gradiently, i.e., different elements/nodes/atoms in the group may have different [vel_x, vel_y, vel_z]. The grad_vel_axis component of the displacement vector is linearly applied to the group based on the positions of elements/nodes/atoms along the grad_ref_axis direction. grad_ref_l and grad_ref_u are the lower and upper bounds of the graded displacement, in unit of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the grad_ref_axis direction, with inf referring to the relevant simulation cell boundaries. The elements/nodes/atoms located at or below grad_ref_l are assigned a zero displacement, i.e., fixed; those located at or above grad_ref_u are assigned [vel_x, vel_y, vel_z]; those located between grad_ref_l and grad_ref_u are assigned a vector whose grad_vel_axis component is linearly graded while the other two components remain the same with respect to [vel_x, vel_y, vel_z].\nIn the third example, the elements/nodes/atoms which are located below 50.0⋅l′⃗0[2]50.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[2]50.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[2] along the y axis (because grad_ref_axis = 2) are assigned a zero displacement vector; those located above 60.0⋅l′⃗0[2]60.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[2]60.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[2] along the y axis are assigned [vel_x, vel_y, vel_z]; those in between are assigned a linearly graded displacement vector whose x component (because grad_vel_axis = 1) is varied between zero and vel_x while its y and z components are vel_y and vel_z, respectively.\nWhen boolean_switch = t, the lower and upper bounds of the graded displacement are switched. In the fourth example, the elements/nodes/atoms which are located below 10.0⋅l′⃗0[3]10.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[3]10.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[3] along the z axis (because grad_ref_axis = 3) are assigned a displacement vector [vel_x, vel_y, vel_z]; those located above 100.0⋅l′⃗0[3]100.0\\cdot\\vec{l'}_0[3]100.0⋅​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​[3] along the z axis are assigned a zero displacement; those in between are assigned a linearly graded displacement vector whose y component (because grad_vel_axis = 2) is varied between zero and vel_y while its x and z components are vel_x and vel_z, respectively.\nRelated commands\nThere cannot be fewer group commands than new_group_number + restart_group_number.

At each simulation step (loading increment), the energy minimization usually consists of two levels of iterations: in the outer iteration, the nodes/atoms are moved along a certain direction; in the inner iteration, a line search is conducted to determin the magnitude of the movement to minimize the energy.\nThere are four mini_style: congjugate gradient (cg), steepest descent (sd), fast inertial relaxation engine (fire), and quick min (qm).\nBoth cg and sd use the negative gradient of potential energy as the initial direction; from the second step, however, the sd style uses the current negative gradient while the cg style uses the negative gradient conjugated to the current potential surface. The line search is used to find the length along which the nodes/atoms need to move along the designated direction to find the minimized energy. For more information of the energy minimization with these two styles, read chapter 3 of Shuozhi Xu's Ph.D. dissertation.\nThe fire style is based on Bitzek et al., 2006 while the qm style is based on quenched dynamics which is used also in dynamic CAC. The difference is that only one quenched dynamics iteration is carried out at each simulation step in dynamic CAC while many quenched dynamics iterations are performed at each simulation step in quasistatic CAC until the energy converges at that step. For the fire and qm styles, the inner iteration is irrelevant.\nThe energy minimiztion is considered to converge when either the outer iteration reaches max_iteraction or the energy variation between successive outer iterations divided by the energy of the current iteration is less than the tolerance.\nRelated commands\nThis command is relevant only when simulator = statics or hybrid.\nRelated files\nquasi_statics.f90, mini_init.f90, update_mini.f90, mini_energy.f90, hybrid.f90, conjugate_gradient.f90, steepest_descent.f90, quick_mini.f90, fire.f90\nDefault\nminimize cg 1000 1d-6\n"},"chapter5/modify_num.html":{"url":"chapter5/modify_num.html","title":"modify_num","keywords":"","body":"modify_num\nSyntax\nmodify_num modify_number\n\nmodify_number = non-negative integer (\n\nExamples\nmodify_num 2\nDescription\nThis command sets the number of modifications that are made to the elements/nodes/atoms that are built from scratch, i.e., when boolean_restart = f.\nRelated commands\nThe modification style is set by the modify command.\nThis command becomes irrelevant when boolean_restart = t.\nRelated files\nmodel_modify.f90\nDefault\nmodify_num 0\n"},"chapter5/modify.html":{"url":"chapter5/modify.html","title":"modify","keywords":"","body":"modify\nSyntax\nmodify modify_name modify_style modify_shape\n       x lower_b upper_b i j k\n       y lower_b upper_b i j k\n       z lower_b upper_b i j k\n       boolean_in boolean_delete_filled modify_axis\n       modify_centroid_x modify_centroid_y modify_centroid_z\n       modify_radius_large modify_radius_small\n\nmodify modify_name modify_style depth tolerance\n\nmodify_name = a string (length \n\nmodify_style = delete or cg2at or cutoff\n\nmodify_shape = block or cylinder or cone or tube or sphere\n\nlower_b, upper_b = real number or inf\n\ni, j, k = real number\n\nboolean_in, boolean_delete_filled = t or f\n  t is true\n  f is false\n\nmodify_axis = 1 or 2 or 3\n\nmodify_centroid_x, modify_centroid_y, modify_centroid_z = real number\n\nmodify_radius_large, modify_radius_small, depth, tolerance = positive real number\n\n\nExamples\nmodify modify_1 delete cylinder x 0. 1. 0.94281 0. -0.33333 y inf inf 0. 1. 0. z inf inf 0. 0. 1. t t 3 50. 50. 1. 2. 5.\nmodify modify_2 cg2at block x inf inf 1. 0. 0. y 1. 12. 0. 0.94281 -0.33333 z inf inf 0. 0. 1. t f 1 20. 4. 5. 17. 13.\nmodify modify_3 cutoff 0.1 0.01\nDescription\nThis command sets the modifications made to the elements/nodes/atoms that are built from scratch, i.e., when boolean_restart = f. The first syntax, to some extent, is similar to that of the group command for the new group.\nThere are currently three modify_style: delete, cg2at, and cutoff. When modify_style = delete or cg2at, the first syntax is used; otherwise, the second syntax with depth and tolerance is used.\nIn the first syntax, there are five modify_shape: block, cylinder, cone, tube, and sphere. delete removes some elements/atoms from the preliminary simulation cell, and cg2at refines some elements into atomic scale.\nlower_b and upper_b are the lower and upper boundaries of the modify_shape, respectively, in unit of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​, for the corresponding direction. When lower_b or upper_b is inf, the corresponding lower or upper simulation cell boundaries are taken as the modify_shape boundaries, respectively.\nlower_b and upper_b are their plane boundaries normal to the central axis modify_axis direction. Note that modify_axis is irrelevant when modify_shape = sphere.\ni, j, and k decide the modify_shape (= block) boundary plane orientations with respect to the simulation cell, similar to those in the box_dir command. When modify_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, they decide the direction of the modify_axis, similar to those in the group command.\nNote that these five options (lower_b, upper_b, i, j, and k) are irrelevant when modify_shape = sphere, and when modify_shape = cylinder or cone or tube if the corresponding direction is not modify_axis. However, they need to be provided regardless.\nWhen boolean_in = t, elements with any of their parts (in the coarse-grained domain) and atoms (in the atomistic domain) inside the modify_shape are deleted (delete) or refined to atomic scale (cg2at); otherwise, those outside are. In the coarse-grained domain, an element might have some part inside and the remaining part outside modify_shape; for this element, with delete, the region that is left behind due to the deletion may not have the shape specified by modify_shape. In this case, if boolean_delete_filled = t, atoms (that are linearly interpolated from the original element) will be filled in to maintain the modify_shape. E.g., if boolean_in = t, the interpolated atoms of the deleted elements that are outside modify_shape are filled in; otherwise, those inside are, as shown in the figure below. Note that boolean_delete_filled is irrelevant when modify_style = cg2at.\n\nmodify_centroid_x, modify_centroid_y, and modify_centroid_z, in unit of the maximum lattice periodicity length lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​, are the coordinates of the center of the base plane of a cylinder or cone or tube, or the center of a sphere. When modify_shape = cylinder or cone or tube, the modify_centroid_* that corresponds to the modify_axis becomes irrelevant. For example, when modify_axis = 3, modify_centroid_z can take any real number without affecting the results.\nmodify_radius_large is the base radius of a cylinder, the large base radius of a cone, the outer base radius of a tube, or the radius of a sphere. modify_radius_small, the small base radius of a cone or the inner base radius of a tube, is irrelevant for other modify_shape. Both modify_radius_large and modify_radius_small are in unit of the maximum lattice periodicity length lmax′l'_\\mathrm{max}l​max​′​​.\nNote that these six options (modify_axis, modify_centroid_*, and modify_radius_*) are not relevant when modify_shape = block. Yet, they need to be provided regardless.\nIn the second syntax, which is for modify_style = cutoff, depth and tolerance, in unit of the component of the lattice periodicity length vector l′⃗0\\vec{l'}_0​l​′​​​⃗​​​0​​ along the grain stack direction, specify the size of the target region and the cutoff distance, respectively, as shown in the figure below.\n\nThis is useful when the interatomic distance tolerance or the distance between a node and an atom tolerance, e.g., at the grain boundary, because of the overlap or grain origin displacements. At first, a check is conducted, within the region set by depth, on both the real atoms in the atomistic domain or the interpolated atoms in the coarse-grained doain. Within a pair, if both are real atoms, the one associated with a smaller grain_id is deleted; if one is a real atom and the other is an interpolated atom, the real atom is deleted; if both are interpolated atoms, an error message is issued because it is impossible to delete an interpolated atom from an element.\nRelated commands\nThere cannot be fewer modify commands than modify_number. When there are too many modify commands in cac.in, those appearing later will be ignored.\nThis command becomes irrelevant when boolean_restart = t or modify_number = 0.\nRelated files\nmodel_modify.f90 and model_modify_interpo.f90\nDefault\nNone.\n"},"chapter5/neighbor.html":{"url":"chapter5/neighbor.html","title":"neighbor","keywords":"","body":"neighbor\nSyntax\nneighbor bin_size neighbor_freq\n\nbin_size = non-negative real number\n\nneighbor_freq = positive integer\n\n\nExamples\nneighbor 1. 100\nneighbor 2. 200\nDescription\nThis command sets parameters for updating the neighbor list.

On the other hand, flat boundaries are sometimes desirable to enforce the periodic boundary conditions or to lower the aphysical stress concentrations at the boundaries.\nIf one of the three booleans in this command is f, atoms will be filled in the jagged interstices, resulting in flat boundaries for the corresponding direction, as shown in ig.

For example, the lattice constant a0a_0a​0​​ in cubic crystal systems is the lattice periodicity length along the 100>\\left⟨100⟩ directions.\nOnce the crystallographic orientations are set, e.g., the xxx axis in the first grain has an orientation of [abc][abc][abc], the lattice will repeat itself at every a2+b2+c2a0\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}a_0√​a​2​​+b​2​​+c​2​​​​​a​0​​ distant along the xxx direction. However, this distant may not be the smallest lattice periodicity length. For example, when [abc]=[112][abc] = [112][abc]=[112], a2+b2+c2a0=6a0\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}a_0 = \\sqrt{6}a_0√​a​2​​+b​2​​+c​2​​​​​a​0​​=√​6​​​a​0​​, yet the smallest lattice periodicity length l0=(6/2)a0l_0 = (\\sqrt{6}/2)a_0l​0​​=(√​6​​​/2)a​0​​.\nSo how is l0l_0l​0​​ calculated for any given [abc][abc][abc]?

For example, if l=24l = 24l=24, one gets 24/2=1224/2 = 1224/2=12, then 12/2=612/2 = 612/2=6, then 6/2=36/2 = 36/2=3, then 333 is not divisible by 2. During this process, lll and its quotients are divided by 2 for 3 times, then one get an integer Δ=3\\Delta = 3Δ=3. Finally, l0=(l/Δ)a0l_0 = (\\sqrt{l}/\\Delta)a_0l​0​​=(√​l​​​/Δ)a​0​​.
