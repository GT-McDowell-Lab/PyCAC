## Units

PyCAC assumes the use of the following defined molecular units:

* The unit of time is $$10^{-12}$$ seconds (i.e., picoseconds)
* The unit of length is $$10^{-10}$$ meters (i.e., Angstroms)
* The unit of mass is $$1.66053904\times 10^{âˆ’27}$$ kilograms (i.e., Daltons - unified atomic mass units)
* The unit of energy $$1.602176565\times 10^{-19}$$ Joules (i.e., eV)
* The unit of pressure is $$10^9$$ Pascales (i.e., GPa)
