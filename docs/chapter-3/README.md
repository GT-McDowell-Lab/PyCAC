# Algorithm

A framework for mixed atomistic/continuum modeling, the CAC algorithm adopts common atomistic modeling and finite element techniques. In the atomistic domain, Newtonâ€™s third law is employed to promote efficiency in calculating the force, pair potential, local electron density, and stress. The short-range neighbor search employs a combined cell list and Verlet list method. In the coarse-grained domain, the Garlekin method and Gaussian quadrature are employed to solve the [governing equations](../chapter-2/atomistic-field-theory.md).

There are, however, several issues in CAC simulations with coarse-graining that do not exist in standard atomistic and finite element method simulations.
