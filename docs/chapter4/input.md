# input.py()

input.py() contains a graphical user interface that can be used to generate the [CAC input script](../chapter5/README.md), and to submit jobs via job schedulers on high performance computing clusters, e.g., those on [NSF XSEDE](http://www.xsede.org).

More information will be added soon.
