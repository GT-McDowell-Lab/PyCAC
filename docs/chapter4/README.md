# Graphical user interface

The PyCAC graphical user interface (GUI) is an application that simplifies the creation, submission, and analysis of CAC simulation projects. 
Written in Python 3, the PyCAC GUI provides a robust interface to facilitate [parametric studies](parameterization.md) via CAC simulations without interacting with the Fortran code and to improve handling of input, output, and visualization options. The module works on local computers and serves as an interface with high performance computing clusters. In particular, the Python module consists of three main functionalities: [New project creation](create.md), [Existing project upload](upload.md), and [Result download/conversion](download.md). 

If you are interested in the using the PyCAC suite for your research, please [email Prof. David L. McDowell](mailto:david.mcdowell@me.gatech.edu) for access to the PyCAC software package and follow the [installation steps](installation.md)

The PyCAC GUI may be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/GT-McDowell-Lab/PyCAC), or from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pycac/) using pip. 

The GUI is currently in its alpha release stage. For bug reports or questions relating directly to the GUI, please contact [Alex Selimov](mailto:aselimov3@gatech.edu) or [Kevin Chu](mailto:kchu41@gatech.edu)
