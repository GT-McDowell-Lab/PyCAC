# Python scripting interface

The Python scripting interface, written by [Thomas G. Payne](http://www.mse.gatech.edu/content/payne), is a Python wrapper module for CAC's underlying Fortran 2008 code, allowing handling of the program's input and output as well as links to some external visualization software. Written in Python 3 and contained in PyCAC.py, the Python module provides a robust user interface to facilitate parametric studies via CAC simulations without interacting with the Fortran code and to improve handling of input, output, and visualization options. The module works on local computers and serves as an interface with high performance computing clusters. In particular, the Python module consists of three main components: [input.py()](input.md), [output.py()](output.md), and [visualization.py()](visualization.md).
