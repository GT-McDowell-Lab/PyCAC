# Introduction

The concurrent atomistic-continuum \(CAC\) method is a partitioned-domain multiscale modeling technique that is applicable to nano/micron scale thermo/mechanical problems in a wide range of monoatomic and polyatomic crystalline materials ([Xu et al., IJP, 2015](cac-publicatoins.html)). A CAC simulation model, in general, partitions the simulation cell into two domains: atomistic and coarse-grained domains.

Differing from most concurrent multiscale methods in the literature, displacement discontinuities 


it is written in FORTRAN with a Python interface.
