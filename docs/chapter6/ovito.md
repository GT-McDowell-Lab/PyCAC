## OVITO

A series of `dump.#` files, containing the positions of the atoms (both the real atoms in the atomistic domain and the interpolated atoms in the coarse-grained domain), are created by the [Python interface](../chapter4/README.md), with a frequency of [`output_freq`](../chapter5/dump.md). A `dump.lammps` file which, in addition to the nodal/atomic positions, may also contain the nodal/atomic velocities information if [`simulation_style`](../chapter5/simulator.md) = _dynamics_ or _hybrid_, is also created in the beginning of the simulation. All these `dump.*` files can be read and analyzed by [OVITO --- The Open Visualization Tool](www.ovito.org), which provides a variety of analyses.

A common usage of OVITO to process the `dump.*` files is to visualize the dislocations. First, [import](https://ovito.org/manual/usage.import.html) any `dump.#` file into OVITO. Then load the [Dislocation analysis (DXA) modifier](https://ovito.org/manual/particles.modifiers.dislocation_analysis.html) and deselect the [Particles in Display](https://ovito.org/manual/display_objects.html). This approach applies to both the FCC and BCC metals.

To visualize lattice defects other than dislocations, e.g., stacking faults, twin boundaries, other [modifiers](https://ovito.org/manual/particles.modifiers.html). For FCC metals, the [Common neighbor analysis](https://ovito.org/manual/particles.modifiers.common_neighbor_analysis.html) modifier can be loaded, followed by that [selected FCC particles](https://ovito.org/manual/particles.modifiers.select_particle_type.html) are [deleted](https://ovito.org/manual/particles.modifiers.delete_selected_particles.html) to visualize the defects. For BCC metals, the [Centrosymmetry parameter](https://ovito.org/manual/particles.modifiers.centrosymmetry.html) modifier can be loaded, then atoms with a large Centrosymmetry parameter are [selected](https://ovito.org/manual/particles.modifiers.expression_select.html) and [deleted](https://ovito.org/manual/particles.modifiers.delete_selected_particles.html) to visualize the defects.
